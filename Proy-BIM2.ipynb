      "Linked Data querying over cached indexes of Web data often suffers from stale or missing results due to infrequent updates and partial coverage of available sources. Conversely, live decentralised approaches offer fresh results taken directly from the Web, but suffer from slow response times due to the expense of numerous remote lookups at runtime. We thus propose a hybrid query approach that improves upon both paradigms, offering fresher results from a broader range of sources than Linked Data caches while offering faster results than live querying. Our hybrid query engine takes a cached and live query engine as black boxes, where a hybrid query planner splits an input query and delegates the appropriate sub-queries to each interface. In this paper, we discuss the core query-planning issues and their main strengths and weaknesses. We also present coherence measures to quantify the coverage and freshness for cached indexes of Linked Data, and show how these measures can be used during query planning to maximise the trade-off between fresh results and fast query execution.\n",
      "Vocabularies are an integral part of Linked Data (LD). They are published as browsable services for humans, as data dumps, as LD services, and as SPARQL endpoints for machines. Vocabulary services, such as concept lookup via term searches and hierarchical browsing, are used by indexers describing documents and searchers looking for suitable keywords. Basing vocabulary services on SPARQL endpoints containing SKOS vocabularies brings several benefits. We present the ONKI Light on SPARQL system, demonstrating how vocabulary services can be implemented using only SPARQL endpoints.\n",
      "RDF aims at being the universal abstract data model for structured data on the Web. While there is effort to convert data in RDF, the vast majority of data available on the Web does not conform to RDF. Indeed, exposing data in RDF, either natively or through wrappers, can be very costly. In this context, transformation or mapping languages that define generation of RDF from non-RDF data represent an efficient solution. Furthermore, the declarative aspect of these solutions makes them easy to adapt to any change in the input data model, or in the output knowledge model. This paper introduces a novel such transformation language spagen, an extension of SPARQL for querying not only RDF datasets but also documents in arbitrary formats. Its implementation on top of Apache Jena currently covers use cases from related work and more, and enables to query and transform web documents in XML, JSON, CSV, HTML, CBOR, and plain text with regular expressions.\n",
      "The growing amount of data being published as Linked Data has a huge potential, but the usage of this data is still cumbersome, especially for non-technical users. Visualizations can help to get a better idea of the type and structure of the available data and can provide a useful starting point for further querying and analysis. In this paper, we present an approach for the extraction of TBox information from SPARQL endpoints, and the visualization of this information using the VOWL notation. SPARQL queries are used to infer concept information from the ABox data of a user-given SPARQL endpoint, which is then gradually added to an interactive VOWL graph visualization. The web application LD-VOWL provides an implementation of this approach, which was tested on several SPARQL endpoints and evaluated in a qualitative user study with very promising results.\n",
      "Efficient usage of the knowledge provided by the Linked Data community is often hindered by the need for domain experts to formulate the right SPARQL queries to answer questions.

Further, we use the resulting SPARQL queries to mimic human associations with a Mean Average Precision (MAP) of 39.9% and a Recall@10 of 63.9%.\n",
      "The Semantic Web community has proposed several query languages for RDF before the World Wide Web Consortium started to standardize SPARQL.

Experiments illustrate the potential of our approach.\n",

Query and retrieval of semantic associations has been an important task in many analytical and scientific activities, such as detecting money laundering schemes and querying for metabolic pathways in biochemistry. We believe that support for semantic path queries should be an integral component of RDF query languages. In this paper, we present SPARQLeR, an extension of the Sparql query language supporting semantic path queries. The proposed extension fits well within the overall syntax and semantics of Sparql and allows easy and natural formulation of queries involving a wide variety of semantic path patterns in RDF graphs. SPARQLeR's path patterns can capture many semantic details of the queried associations. We also present an implementation of SPARQLeR and its initial performance results. Our implementation is built over our own BRAHMS RDF storage system.\n",

      "In machine learning/data mining, people have been exploring how to learn models of relational data for a long time. The rational behind this is that exploiting the rich and complex structure of relational data enables to build better models by taking into account the additional information provided by the links between objects. These links are usually hard to model by traditional propositional learning techniques.  We extend this idea to the Semantic Web. In this paper we introduce a novel approach we call SPARQL-ML to perform data mining for Semantic Web data. Our approach is based on traditional SPARQL and statistical relational learning methods, such as Relational Probability Trees and Relational Bayesian Classifiers.  We analyze our approach thoroughly conducting three sets of experiments on synthetic as well as real-world datasets. Our analytical results show that our approach can be used for any Semantic Web dataset to perform instance-based learning and classification. A comparison to kernel methods used in Support Vector Machines shows that our approach is superior in terms of classification accuracy. Moreover, we show how our approach can be used for Semantic Web service classification and automatic semantic annotation.\n"

The strategies for matchmaking which we develop and evaluate in the paper make use of a plethora of similarity measures and combination functions from SimPack -- our library of similarity measures for the use in ontologies. We show how our combination of structured and imprecise querying can be used to perform hybrid Semantic Web service matchmaking in simple and amazingly fast fashion. We analyze our approach thoroughly on a large OWL-S service test collection, and show how our initial strategies can be improved by applying machine learning algorithms such as regression, decision trees, or support vector machines to result in the most effective strategies for matchmaking.\n",
      "Integrated access to multiple distributed and autonomous RDF data sources is a key challenge for many semantic web applications. As a reaction to this challenge, SPARQL, the current W3C Proposed Recommendation for an RDF query language, supports querying of multiple RDF graphs. However, the current standard does not provide transparent query federation, which makes query formulation hard and lengthy. Furthermore, current implementations of SPARQL load all RDF graphs mentioned in a query to the local machine. This usually incurs a large overhead in network traffic, and sometimes is simply impossible for technical or legal reasons. To overcome these problems we present DARQ, an engine for federated SPARQL queries. DARQ provides transparent query access to multiple SPARQL services, i.e., it gives the user the impression to query one single RDF graph despite the real data being distributed on the web. A service description language enables the query engine to decompose a query into sub-queries, each of which can be answered by an individual service. DARQ also uses query rewriting and cost-based query optimization to speed-up query execution. Experiments show that these optimizations significantly improve query performance even when only a very limited amount of statistical information is available. DARQ is available under GPL License at http://darq.sf.net/.\n",
      "A lot of work has been done in the area of data stream processing. Most of the previous approaches regard only relational or XML based streams but do not cover semantic richer RDF based stream elements. In our work, we extend SPARQL, the W3C recommendation for an RDF query language, to process RDF data streams. To describe the semantics of our enhancement, we extended the logical SPARQL algebra for stream processing on the foundation of a temporal relational algebra based on multi sets and provide an algorithm to transform SPARQL queries to the new extended algebra. For each logical algebra operator, we defined executable physical counterparts. To show the feasibility of our approach, we implemented it within our ODYSSEUS framework in the context of wind power plant monitoring.\n",
      "With currently available tools and languages, translating between an existing XML format and RDF is a tedious and error-prone task. The importance of this problem is acknowledged by the W3C GRDDL working group who faces the issue of extracting RDF data out of existing HTML or XML files, as well as by the Web service community around SAWSDL, who need to perform lowering and lifting between RDF data from a semantic client and XML messages for a Web service. However, at the moment, both these groups rely solely on XSLT transformations between RDF/XML and the respective other XML format at hand. In this paper, we propose a more natural approach for such transformations based on merging XQuery and SPARQL into the novel language XSPARQL. We demonstrate that XSPARQL provides concise and intuitive solutions for mapping between XML and RDF in either direction, addressing both the use cases of GRDDL and SAWSDL. We also provide and describe an initial implementation of an XSPARQL engine, available for user evaluation.\n",

Building on developments of {\\em social network analysis},  {\\em graph databases} and {\\em Semantic Web},  we present a social networks data model  based on RDF, and a query and transformation language based on SPARQL meeting the above requirements.

      "Today a large amount of RDF data is published on the Web. However, the openness of the Web and the ease to combine RDF data from different sources creates new challenges. The Web of data is missing a uniform way to assess and to query the trustworthiness of information. In this paper we present tSPARQL, a trust-aware extension to SPARQL. Two additional keywords enable users to describe trust requirements and to query the trustworthiness of RDF data. Hence, tSPARQL allows adding trust to RDF-based applications in an easy manner. As the foundation we propose a trust model that associates RDF statements with trust values and we extend the SPARQL semantics to access these trust values in tSPARQL. Furthermore, we discuss opportunities to optimize the execution of tSPARQL queries.\n",
      "Many applications operate on time-“sensitive” data. Some of these data are only valid for certain intervals (e.g., job-assignments, versions of software code), others describe temporal events that happened at certain points in time (e.g., a person’s birthday). Until recently, the only way to incorporate time into Semantic Web models was as a data type property. Temporal RDF, however, considers time as an additional dimension in data preserving the semantics of time.   In this paper we present a syntax and storage format based on named graphs to express temporal RDF. Given the restriction to preexisting RDF-syntax, our approach can perform any temporal query using standard SPARQL syntax only. For convenience, we introduce a shorthand format called T-SPARQL for temporal queries and show how T-SPARQL queries can be translated to standard SPARQL. Additionally, we show that, depending on the underlying data's nature, the temporal RDF approach vastly reduces the number of triples by eliminating redundancies resulting in an increased performance for processing and querying. Last but not least, we introduce a new indexing approach method that can significantly reduce the time needed to execute time point queries (e.g., what happened on January 1st).\n",
      "In SPARQL queries, the combination of triple patterns is expressed by using shared variables across patterns. Based on this characterization, basic graph patterns in a SPARQL query can be partitioned into groups of acyclic pattern combinations that share exactly  one variable,  or star-shaped groups.  We observe that the number of triples in a group is proportional to the number of individuals that play the role of the subject or the object; however, depending on the degree of participation of the subject individuals in the properties, a group could be not much larger than a class or type to which the subject or object belongs. Thus, it may be significantly more efficient to independently evaluate each of the groups, and then merge the resulting sets, than linearly joining all triples in a basic graph pattern. Based on these properties of star-shaped groups, we have developed query optimization and evaluation techniques. We have conducted an empirical analysis on the benefits of the optimization and evaluation techniques  in several SPARQL query engines. We observe that our proposed  techniques are able to speed up  query evaluation time for join queries with star-shaped patterns by at least one order of magnitude.\n",
      "The performance of triple stores is one of the major obstacles for the deployment of semantic technologies in many usage scenarios. In particular, Semantic Web applications, which use triple stores as persistence backends, trade performance for the advantage of flexibility with regard to information structuring. In order to get closer to the performance of relational database-backed Web applications, we developed an approach for improving the performance of triple stores by caching query results and even complete application objects. The selective invalidation of cache objects, following updates of the underlying knowledge bases, is based on analysing the graph patterns of cached SPARQL queries in order to obtain information about what kind of updates will change the query result. We evaluated our approach by extending the BSBM triple store benchmark with an update dimension as well as in typical Semantic Web application scenarios.\n"

      "RDF is the metadata model of choice in the Semantic Sensor Web. However, RDF can only represent thematic metadata and needs to be extended if we want to model spatial and temporal information. For this purpose, we develop the data model stRDF and the query language stSPARQL. stRDF is a constraint data model that extends RDF with the ability to represent spatial and temporal data. stSPARQL extends SPARQL so that spatial and temporal data can be queried using a declarative and user-friendly language. We follow the main ideas of spatial and temporal constraint databases and represent spatial objects as quantifier-free formulas in a first-order logic of linear constraints. The main contribution of stRDF is to bring to the RDF world the benefits of constraint databases and constraint-based reasoning so that spatial and temporal data can be represented in RDF using constraints. In this paper, we present the syntax and semantics of stRDF and stSPARQL and discuss some details of our in-progress implementation.\n",
      "The SPARQL query language is currently being extended by W3C with so-called entailment regimes, which define how queries are evaluated under more expressive semantics than simple entailment. We describe a sound and complete algorithm for the OWL Direct Semantics entailment regime. The queries of the regime are very expressive since variables can occur within complex class expressions and can also bind to class or property names. We propose several novel optimizations such as strategies for determining a good query execution order, query rewriting techniques, and show how specialized OWL reasoning tasks and the class and property hierarchy can be used to reduce the query execution time. We provide a prototypical implementation and evaluate the efficiency of the proposed optimizations. For standard conjunctive queries our system performs comparably to already deployed systems. For complex queries an improvement of up to three orders of magnitude can be observed.\n",

In this paper, we provide a formalization of the syntax and semantics of the SPARQL 1.1 federation extension, an important fragment of the language that has not yet received much attention. Besides, we propose optimization techniques for this fragment, provide an implementation of the fragment including these techniques, and carry out a series of experiments that show that our optimization procedures could significantly speed up the query evaluation process.\n",
      "An advantage of Semantic Web standards like RDF and OWL is their flexibility in modifying the structure of a knowledge base. To turn this flexibility into a practical advantage, it is of high importance to have tools and methods, which offer similar flexibility in extracting information from a knowledge base. This is closely related to the ability to easily formulate queries over those knowledge bases. We explain benefits and drawbacks of existing techniques in achieving this goal and then present the QTL algorithm, which fills a gap in research and practice. It uses supervised machine learning and allows users to ask queries without knowing the schema of the underlying knowledge base beforehand and without expertise in the SPARQL query language. We then present the AutoSPARQL user interface, which implements an active learning approach on top of QTL. Finally, we present an evaluation based on the SPARQL query log of the DBpedia knowledge base.\n",

Such a task is increasingly challenging given the ever growing volume of publications and data sets. Towards addressing this challenge, we previously developed HyQue, a prototype system for hypothesis formulation and evaluation. HyQue uses domain-specific rule sets to evaluate hypotheses based on well understood scientific principles. However, because scientists may use differing scientific premises when exploring a hypothesis, flexibility is required in both crafting and executing rule sets to evaluate hypotheses. Here, we report on an extension of HyQue that incorporates rules specified using the SPARQL Inferencing Notation (SPIN). Hypotheses, background knowledge, queries, results and now rule sets are represented and executed using Semantic Web technologies, enabling users to explicitly trace a hypothesis to its evaluation, including the data and rules used by HyQue. We demonstrate the use of HyQue to evaluate hypotheses about the yeast galactose gene system.\n",
      "The World Wide Web currently evolves into a Web of Linked Data where content providers publish and link data as they have done with hypertext for the last 20 years. While the declarative query language SPARQL is the de facto for querying a-priory defined sets of data from the Web, no language exists for querying the Web of Linked Data itself. However, it seems natural to ask whether SPARQL is also suitable for such a purpose. In this paper we formally investigate the applicability of SPARQL as a query language for Linked Data on the Web. In particular, we study two query models: 1) a full-Web semantics where the scope of a query is the complete set of Linked Data on the Web and 2) a family of reachability-based semantics which restrict the scope to data that is reachable by traversing certain data links. For both models we discuss properties such as monotonicity and computability as well as the implications of querying a Web that is infinitely large due to data generating servers.\n",

We approach the problem from the perspective of Constraint Programming (CP), a technology designed for solving NP-hard problems.  Such technology allows us to exploit SPARQL filters early-on during the search instead of as a post-processing step.  We propose Castor, a new SPARQL engine based on CP.  Castor performs very competitively compared to state-of-the-art engines.\n",

In addition to taxonomic knowledge about concepts and properties typically expressible in languages such as RDFS and OWL, we focus on knowledge determined by arithmetic equations. The main use case is exploiting knowledge about functional dependencies among numerical properties expressible by means of such arithmetic equations. While some of this knowledge is expressible for instance in rule extensions to  ontology languages, we provide a more flexible framework that treats property equations as first class citizens in the ontology language. The combination of ontological reasoning and property equations is realized by extending query rewriting techniques already successfully applied for ontology languages such as (the DL-fragment of) RDFS, or also OWL QL, respectively. We deploy this technique for rewriting SPARQL queries and discuss the feasibility of alternative implementations, such as rule-based approaches.\n",

The predominant way to implement analytical query capabilities in industry are specialised engines that translate OLAP queries to SQL queries on a relational database using a star schema (ROLAP). A more direct approach than ROLAP is to load Statistical Linked Data into an RDF store and to answer OLAP queries using SPARQL. However, we assume that general-purpose triple stores -- just as typical relational databases -- are no perfect fit for analytical workloads and need to be complemented by OLAP-to-SPARQL engines. To give an empirical argument for the need of such an engine, we first compare our generated SPARQL to ROLAP SQL queries in terms of performance. Second, we measure the performance gain of RDF aggregate views that, similar to aggregate tables in ROLAP, materialise part of the data cube.\n"

These queries usually differ only in a small number of individual triple pattern parts, such as resource labels or literals in objects. We present an approach to detect such recurring patterns in queries and introduce the notion of query templates, which represent clusters of similar queries exhibiting these recurrences. We describe a matching algorithm to extract query templates and illustrate the benefits of prefetching data by utilizing these templates.

This work presents HiBISCuS, a novel hypergraph-based source selection approach         to federated SPARQL querying. Our approach can be directly combined with existing SPARQL         query federation engines to achieve the same recall while querying fewer data sources. We         extend three well-known SPARQL query federation engines -- DARQ, SPLENDID, and FedX -- with         HiBISCus and compare our extensions with the original approaches on FedBench. Our evaluation         shows that HiBISCuS can efficiently reduce the total number of sources selected without         losing the recall.

      "More and more RDF data is exposed on the Web via SPARQL endpoints. With the recent SPARQL 1.1 standard, these datasets can be queried in novel and more powerful ways, e.g., complex analysis tasks involving grouping and aggregation, and even data from multiple SPARQL endpoints, can now be formulated in a single query. This enables Business Intelligence applications that access data from federated web sources and can combine it with local data. However, as both aggregate and federated queries have become available only recently, state-of-the-art systems lack sophisticated optimization techniques that facilitate efficient execution of such queries over large datasets. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose a set of query processing strategies and the associated Cost-based Optimizer for Distributed Aggregate queries (CoDA) for executing aggregate SPARQL queries over federations of SPARQL endpoints. Our comprehensive experiments show that CoDA significantly improves performance over current state-of-the-art systems.\n",

A natural candidate seems to be SPARQL, which recently has been enhanced with navigational capabilities thanks to the introduction of property paths (PPs). However, the semantics of SPARQL restricts the scope of navigation via PPs to single RDF graphs. This restriction limits the applicability of PPs on the Web. To fill this gap, in this paper we provide formal foundations for evaluating PPs on the Web, thus contributing to the definition of a query language for Linked Data. In particular, we introduce a query semantics for PPs that couples navigation at the data level with navigation on the Web graph. Given this semantics we find that for some PP-based SPARQL queries a complete evaluation on the Web is not feasible. To enable systems to identify queries that can be evaluated completely, we establish a syntactic and, thus, decidable property of such queries.\n",

In this demo paper we validate the feasibility of our approach with a prototype as a proof of concept.\n",
      "Building rich axiomatic ontologies automatically is a step towards the realization of the Semantic Web. In this paper, we describe an automatic approach to extract complex classes’ axioms from Wikipedia definitions based on recurring syntactic structures. The objective is to enrich DBpedia concept descriptions with formal definitions. We leverage RDF to build a sentence representation and SPARQL to model patterns and their transformations, thus easing the querying of syntactic structures and the reusability of the extracted patterns. Our preliminary evaluation shows that we obtain satisfying results, which will be further improved.\n",
      "The problem of updating ontologies has received increased attention in recent years. In the approaches proposed so far, either the update language is restricted to (sets of) atomic updates, or, where the full SPARQL update language is allowed, the TBox language is restricted so that no inconsistencies can arise. In this paper we discuss directions to overcome these limitations. Starting from a DL-Lite fragment covering RDFS and concept disjointness axioms, we define three semantics for SPARQL update: under cautious semantics, inconsistencies are resolved by rejecting updates potentially introducing conflicts; under brave semantics, instead, conflicts are overridden in favor of new information where possible; finally, the fainthearted semantics is a compromise between the former two approaches, designed to accommodate as much of the new information as possible, as long as consistency with the prior knowledge is not violated. We show how these semantics can be implemented in SPARQL via rewritings of polynomial size and draw first conclusions from their practical evaluation.\n",
      "In this demo paper, a SPARQL Query Recommendation Tool (called SQRT) based on query reformulation is presented. Based on three steps, Generalization, Specialization and Evaluation, SQRT implements the logic of reformulating a SPARQL query that is satisfiable w.r.t a source RDF dataset, into others that are satisfiable w.r.t a target RDF dataset. In contrast with the existing approaches, SQRT aims at recommending queries whose reformulations: i) reflect as much as possible the same intended meaning, structure, type of results and result size as the original query and ii) do not require to have a mapping between the  two datasets. Based on a set of criteria to measure the similarity between the initial query and the  recommended ones, SQRT demonstrates the feasibility of the underlying  query reformulation process, ranks appropriately the recommended queries, and offers a valuable support for query recommendations over an unknown and unmapped target RDF dataset, not only assisting the user in learning the data model and content of an RDF dataset, but also supporting its use without requiring the user to have intrinsic knowledge of the data.\n"

OWL axioms can be the basis for the development of schema-aware optimisation techniques that will allow significant improvements in the performance of RDF query engines when used in tandem with data statistics or other heuristics. The aim of this paper is to show the potential of this idea, by discussing a diverse set of cases that depict how schema information can assist SPARQL query optimisers.\n",

It is a key component for developing question-answering (QA) systems on RDF data. The chosen formal representation language in this case is often SPARQL. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, called AskNow, where users can pose queries in English to a target RDF knowledge base (e.g. DBpedia), which are first normalized into an intermediary canonical syntactic form, called Normalized Query Structure (NQS), and then translated into SPARQL queries. NQS facilitates the identification of the desire (or expected output information) and the user-provided input information, and establishing their mutual semantic relationship. At the same time, it is sufficiently adaptive to query paraphrasing. We have empirically evaluated the framework with respect to the syntactic robustness of NQS and semantic accuracy of the SPARQL translator on standard benchmark datasets.\n",
      "Powered by Semantic Web technologies the Linked Data paradigm aims at weaving a globally interconnected graph of raw data that transforms the ways we publish, retrieve, share, reuse, and integrate data from a variety of distributed and heterogeneous sources. In practice, however, this vision faces substantial challenges with respect to data quality, coverage, and longevity,  the amount of background knowledge required to query distant data, the  reproducibility of query results and their derived (scientific) findings, and the lack of computational capabilities required for many tasks.  One key issues underlying these challenges is the trade-off between storing data and computing them. Intuitively, data that is derived from already stored data, changes frequently in space and time,  or is the result of some workflow or procedure, should be compute. However, this functionality is not readily available on the Linked Data cloud and its technology stack. In this work, we introduce a  proxy that can transparently run on top of arbitrary SPARQL endpoints and enables the on-demand computation of Linked Data together with the provenance information required to understand how they were derived. While our work can be generalized to multiple domains, we focus on two geographic use case to showcase the proxy's capabilities.\n",
      "RDF aims at being the universal abstract data model for structured data on the Web. While there is effort to convert data in RDF, the vast majority of data available on the Web does not conform to RDF. Indeed, exposing data in RDF, either natively or through wrappers, can be very costly. Furthermore, in the emerging Web of Things, resource constraints of devices prevent from processing RDF graphs. Hence one cannot expect that all the data on the Web be available as RDF anytime soon. Several tools can generate RDF from non-RDF data, and transformation or mapping languages have been designed to offer more flexible solutions (GRDDL, XSPARQL, R2RML, RML, CSVW, etc.). In this paper, we introduce a new language, SPARQL-Generate, that generates RDF from: (i) a RDF Dataset, and (ii) a set of documents in arbitrary formats. As SPARQL-Generate is designed as an extension of SPARQL 1.1, it can provably: (i) be implemented on top on any existing SPARQL engine, and (ii) leverage the SPARQL extension mechanism to deal with an open set of formats. Furthermore, we show evidence that (iii) it can be easily learned by knowledge engineers that know SPARQL 1.1, and (iv) our first naive open source implementation performs better than the reference implementation of RML for big transformations.\n",

Often, SPARQL queries are hard-coded into Linked Data consuming applications. This tight coupling poses many issues in code maintainability, since these queries are prone to change to adapt to new situations; and query reuse, since queries that might be useful in other applications become not accessible. In order to enable decoupling, version control, availability and accessibility of SPARQL queries, we propose SPARQL2Git, an interface for editing, curating and storing SPARQL queries that uses Git repository managers (such as GitHub) as a backend. We describe the query managing capabilities of SPARQL2Git, its convenience for SPARQL users that lack Git knowledge, and its combination with grlc to easily generate Linked Data APIs.\n",

PeNeLoop exploits redundant sources to parallelize the join operator and reduce execution time. We implemented PeNeLoop in the federated query engine FedX with the replicatedaware source selection Fedra and we empirically evaluated the performance of FedX ` Fedra ` PeNeLoop.

In this paper wepresent RETRO, which investigates the reverse direction i.e. to look atRDF through Relational lenses. RETRO generates a relational schemafrom an RDF store, enabling a user to query RDF data using SQL.A significant advantage of this direction in-addition to interoperabilityis that it makes numerous relational tools developed over past severaldecades, available to the RDF stores. In order to provide interoperabilitybetween these two DB systems one needs to resolve the heterogeneitybetween their respective data models and include schema mapping, datamapping and query mapping in the transformation process [1]. However,like D2RQ, RETRO chooses not to physically transform the data anddeals only with schema mapping and query mapping. RETRO’s schemamapping derives a domain specific relational schema from RDF dataand its query mapping transforms an SQL query over the schema into aprovably equivalent SPARQL query, which in-turn is executed upon theRDF store. Since RETRO is a read-only framework, its query mappinguses only a relevant and relationally complete subset of SQL. A proofof correctness of this transformation is given based on compositionalsemantics of the two query languages.\n",

      "It has been largely recognized that navigational capabilities are fundamental for graph databases query languages. However, although RDF is a directed labeled graph data format, the W3C Recommendation query language for RDF, SPARQL, only provides limited navigational functionalities. This has motivated several authors to propose extensions of SPARQL, or alternative query languages, that offer functionalities for navigating RDF data. In particular, we argued in [6] that nested regular expressions are appropriate to overcome this limitation, and we proposed a query language called nSPARQL that extends SPARQL with this type of expressions.  In this paper, we continue with the investigation of nSPARQL. First, we show that nested regular expressions can be evaluated efficiently; if the appropriate data structure is used to store RDF graphs, then the evaluation of a nested regular expression E over an RDF graph G can be computed in time O(|G|*|E|). Second, as RDF graphs may contain RDFS vocabulary, we study how the navigational capabilities of nSPARQL can be used to evaluate queries according to the predefined semantics of RDFS. Evaluating queries which involve the RDFS vocabulary is challenging, and there is not yet consensus in the Semantic Web community on how to define a query language for RDFS. In this respect, we show that nSPARQL is expressive enough to answer SPARQL queries involving RDFS vocabulary by directly traversing the input RDF graphs. Moreover, we also prove that nesting is necessary to obtain this result. Namely, we show that, in general, regular expressions alone cannot be used to obtain the answer of a SPARQL query involving RDFS vocabulary.\n",
      "Efficient RDF data management is one of the cornerstones in realizing the Semantic Web vision. In the past, different RDF storage strategies have been proposed, ranging from simple triple stores to more advanced techniques like clustering or vertical partitioning on the predicates. We present an experimental comparison of existing storage strategies on top of the SP^2Bench SPARQL performance benchmark suite and put the results into context by comparing them to a purely relational model of the benchmark scenario. We observe that (1) in terms of performance and scalability, a simple triple store built on top of a column-store DBMS is competitive to the vertically partitioned approach when choosing a physical (predicate, subject, object) sort order, (2) in our scenario with real-world queries, none of the approaches scales to documents containing tens of millions of RDF triples, and (3) none of the approaches yet can compete with a purely relational model.

Additionally, it features a full expression algebra based on the syntax of OpenOffice Calc and various shift operations, which can be used to repeat similar mappings in order to wrap cross tables including multiple sheets and spreadsheet files. The set of available expression functions includes most of the native functions of OpenOffice Calc and can be easily extended by users of XLWrap. Additionally, XLWrap is able to execute SPARQL queries, and since it is possible to define multiple virtual class extents in a mapping specification, it can be used to integrate information from multiple spreadsheets. XLWrap supports a special identity concept which allows to link anonymous resources (blank nodes) - which may originate from different spreadsheets - in the target graph.\n",
      "The Web of Linked Data forms a single, globally distributed dataspace. Due to the openness of this dataspace, it is not possible to know in advance all data sources that might be relevant for query answering. This openness poses a new challenge that is not addressed by traditional research on federated query processing. In this paper we present an approach to execute SPARQL queries over the Web of Linked Data. The main idea of our approach is to discover data that might be relevant for answering a query during the query execution itself. This discovery is driven by following RDF links between data sources based on URIs in the query and in partial results. The URIs are resolved over the HTTP protocol into RDF data which is continuously added to the queried dataset. This paper describes concepts and algorithms to implement our approach using an iterator-based pipeline. We introduce a formalization of the pipelining approach and show that classical iterators may cause blocking due to the latency of HTTP requests. To avoid blocking, we propose an extension of the iterator paradigm. The evaluation of our approach shows its strengths as well as the still existing challenges.\n",

The aim of (i) is to enable transparent transformations between these two representation formats, relying on a new query language called XSPARQL. On a different aspect, representing and reasoning with meta-information about RDF triples has been addressed by several proposals for representing time, trust and provenance. A common extension of RDF (and RDFS inferencing rules), capable of encompassing all these proposals, with a clearly defined semantics is much desirable.

Often ontology matching is very difficult problem and it sometimes produces mappings under a certain reliability.

We first compare results from two public SPARQL stores against current versions of the Linked Data sources they cache; results are often missing or out-of-date. We thus propose using coherence estimates to split a query into a sub-query for which the cached data have good fresh coverage, and a sub-query that should instead be run live. Finally, we evaluate different hybrid query plans and split positions in a real-world setup. Our results show that hybrid query execution can improve freshness vs. fully cached results while reducing the time taken vs. fully live execution.\n",

The data sets used in the benchmark have been carefully chosen, such that they represent a realistic and relevant usage of streaming data. The benchmark defines a concise, yet comprehensive set of queries that cover the major aspects of strRS processing. Finally, our work is complemented with a functional evaluation on three representative strRS engines: SPARQLStream, C-SPARQL and CQELS. The presented results are meant to give a first baseline and illustrate the state-of-the-art.\n"

      "The distributed and heterogeneous nature of Linked Open Data requires flexible and federated techniques for query evaluation. In order to evaluate current federation querying approaches a general methodology for conducting benchmarks is mandatory. In this paper, we present a classification methodology for federated SPARQL queries. This methodology can be used by developers of federated querying approaches to compose a set of test benchmarks that cover diverse characteristics of different queries and allows for comparability. We further develop a heuristic called SPLODGE for automatic generation of benchmark queries that is based on this methodology and takes into account the number of sources to be queried and several complexity parameters. We evaluate the adequacy of our methodology and the query generation strategy by applying them on the 2011 billion triple challenge data set.\n",
      "We describe a system that incrementally translates SPARQL queries to Pig Latin and executes them on a Hadoop cluster. This system is designed to work efficiently on complex queries with many self-joins over huge datasets, avoiding job failures even in the case of joins with unexpected high-value skew. To be robust against cost estimation errors, our system interleaves query optimization with query execution, determining the next steps to take based on data samples and statistics gathered during the previous step. Furthermore, we have developed a novel skew-resistant join algorithm that replicates tuples corresponding to popular keys. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach both on a synthetic benchmark known to generate complex queries (BSBM-BI) as well as on a Yahoo! case of data analysis using RDF data crawled from the web. Our results indicate that our system is indeed capable of processing huge datasets without pre-computed statistics while exhibiting good load-balancing properties.\n",
      "Testbeds proposed so far to evaluate, compare, and eventually improve SPARQL query federation systems have still some limitations. Some variables and configurations that may have an impact on the behavior of these systems (e.g., network latency, data partitioning and query properties) are not sufficiently defined; this affects the results and repeatability of independent evaluation studies, and hence the insights that can be obtained from them. In this paper we evaluate FedBench, the most comprehensive testbed up to now, and empirically probe the need of considering additional dimensions and variables. The evaluation has been conducted on three SPARQL query federation systems, and the analysis of these results has allowed to uncover properties of these systems that would normally be hidden with the original testbeds.\n",
      "BioPortal is a repository of biomedical ontologies - the largest such repository, with more than 300 ontologies to date. This set includes ontologies that were developed in OWL, OBO and other languages, as well as a large number of medical terminologies that the US National Library of Medicine distributes in its own proprietary format. We have published the RDF based serializations of all these ontologies and their metadata at sparql.bioontology.org. This dataset contains 203M triples, representing both content and metadata for the 300+ ontologies; and 9M mappings between terms. This endpoint can be queried with SPARQL which opens new usage scenarios for the biomedical domain.

Proprietary event processing solutions do not have enough interoperation flexibility, easily leading to overlapping functions wasting hardware and software resources as well as data communications. Our goal is to verify the applicability of standard-compliant SPARQL for any complex event processing task. If found feasible, semantic web methods RDF, SPARQL and OWL have the built-in support for interconnecting disjoint vocabularies, enriching event information with linked open data and reasoning over semantically annotated content, yielding a very flexible event processing environment. Our approach is designed to meet these requirements. Our INSTANS platform based on continuous execution of interconnected SPARQL queries using the Rete-algorithm is a new approach showing improved performance for event processing tasks over current SPARQL-based solutions.\n",
      "In this paper, we discuss PigSPARQL, a competitive, yet easy to use, SPARQL query processing system based on MapReduce and thus intended for Big Data applications. Instead of a direct mapping, PigSPARQL uses the query language of Pig, a data analysis platform on top of Hadoop, as an intermediate layer between SPARQL and MapReduce. The additional level of abstraction makes our approach independent of the actual Hadoop version. Thus, it is automatically compatible to future changes of the Hadoop framework as they will be neutralized by the Pig layer and allows ad-hoc SPARQL query processing on large RDF graphs out of the box. In the paper we first revisit PigSPARQL and demonstrate PigSPARQL's gain of efficiency simply because switching from version Pig 0.5.0 to Pig 0.11.0. Because of this sustainability, PigSPARQL is an attractive long-term baseline for comparing various MapReduce based SPARQL implementations. This is underlined by PigSPARQL's competitiveness with existing systems, e.g. HadoopRDF.\n",

      "The Web of Data (WoD) continues to grow steadily each year. At over 31 billion triples in 2011, querying this globally distributed data space poses several scalability challenges. One critical aspect when processing distributed SPARQL queries is given by the number and type of distributed joins needed. Traditionally, query optimizers alleviate this issue by attempting to find an optimal query plan assuming a given and fixed data distribution. Discarding this fixed data partitioning assumption, offers the opportunity to create a data distribution that minimizes the number of distributed joins. Recent research focused on data- and query-driven partitioning strategies for both RDF and relational data. In this paper we propose a novel and naive workload-driven approach to data partitioning and investigate the impact of various critical factors on the number of resulting distributed joins. In a preliminary experiment we empirically compare our method to traditional partitioning strategies using a DBpedia query log of 400’000 queries and observe that it can produce up to 50% less distributed joins than an expert (manual) partitioning scheme, 45% less than partitioning based on hashing by subject and up to 83% less distributed joins than just random assignment.\n"

We extend the SPARQL algebra to incorporate keyword search clauses as ﬁrst-class citizens and apply novel optimization techniques to improve the query processing eﬃciency while maintaining a meaningful ranking of results. By performing on-the-ﬂy adaptation of the query execution plan and intelligent grouping of query clauses, we are able to reduce signiﬁcantly the communication costs making our approach suitable for top-k hybrid search across multiple data sources. In experiments we demonstrate that our optimization techniques can lead to a substantial performance improvement, reducing the execution time of hybrid queries by more than an order of magnitude.\n",

      "Query containment is the problem of deciding if the answers to a query are included in those of another query for any queried database. This problem is very important for query optimization purposes. In the SPARQL context, it can be equally useful. This problem has recently been investigated theoretically and some query containment solvers are available. Yet, there were no benchmarks to compare theses systems and foster their improvement. In order to experimentally assess implementation strengths and limitations, we provide a rst SPARQL containment test benchmark. It has been designed with respect to both the capabilities of existing solvers and the study of typical queries. Some solvers support optional constructs and cycles, while other solvers support pro jection, union of conjunctive queries and RDF Schemas. No solver currently supports all these features or OWL entailment regimes. The study of query demographics on DBPedia logs shows that the vast ma jority of queries are acyclic and a signicant part of them uses UNION or pro jection. We thus test available solvers on their domain of applicability on three dierent benchmark suites. These experiments show that (i) tested solutions are overall functionally correct, (ii) in spite of its complexity, SPARQL query containment is practicable for acyclic queries, (iii) state-of-the-art solvers are at an early stage both in terms of capability and implementation.\n",
      "Hundreds of public SPARQL endpoints have been deployed on the Web, forming a novel decentralised infrastructure for querying billions of structured facts from a variety of sources on a plethora of topics. But is this infrastructure mature enough to support applications? For 427 public SPARQL endpoints registered on the DataHub, we conduct various experiments to test their maturity. Regarding discoverability, we nd that only one-third of endpoints make descriptive meta-data available, making it dicult to locate or learn about their content and capabilities. Regarding interoperability, we nd patchy support for established SPARQL features like ORDER BY as well as (understandably) for new SPARQL 1.1 features. Regarding eciency, we show that the performance of endpoints for generic queries can vary by up to 34 orders of magnitude. Regarding availability, based on a 27-month long monitoring experiment, we show that only 32.2% of public endpoints can be expected to have (monthly) two-nines uptimes of 99100%.\n",

In this demonstration, we showcase SPARQL-DJ, a web-based application implementing those layers for the workflow of generating MIDI mashups using Linked Data and SPARQL. The demonstration focuses on three parts: (1) coverage of the mashup composition workflow; (2) scoping of input retrieval for beatmaching by broadening text search and leveraging track annotations; and (3) management of off-beat and dissonance.\n",

However, clearly separating preferences from the \"hard\" patterns and filters in the \"WHERE\" clause gives queries where the intention of the client is more cleanly expressed, an advantage for both human readability and machine optimization. In the paper we formally define the syntax and the semantics of the extension and we also provide empirical evidence that optimizations specific to SPREFQL improve run-time efficiency by comparison to the usually applied optimizations on the equivalent standard SPARQL query.\n"

We performed a user study in which participants wrote a set of queries in both languages.We measured both objective performance as well as subjective responses to a set of questionnaire items. Results indicate that SemwidgQL is easier to learn, more efficient, and preferred by learners.

      "Answering queries over a federation of SPARQL endpoints requires combining data from more than one data source. Optimizing queries in such scenarios is particularly challenging not only because of (i) the large variety of possible query execution plans that correctly answer the query but also because (ii) there is only limited access to statistics about schema and instance data of remote sources. To overcome these challenges, most federated query engines rely on heuristics to reduce the space of possible query execution plans or on dynamic programming strategies to produce optimal plans. Nevertheless, these plans may still exhibit a high number of intermediate results or high execution times because of heuristics and inaccurate cost estimations. In this paper, we present Odyssey, an approach that uses statistics that allow for a more accurate cost estimation for federated queries. Our experimental results show that Odyssey produces query execution plans that are better in terms of data transfer and execution time than state-of-the-art optimizers. Our experiments using the FedBench benchmark show execution time gains of at least one order of magnitude on average.\n",

Although SPARQL queries provide a convenient way of expressing data requests over RDF knowledge graphs, the level of support for hybrid information needs is limited: existing query engines usually focus on retrieving RDF data and only support a set of hard-coded built-in services. To deal with this problem, we present Ephedra: a SPARQL federation engine aimed at processing hybrid queries, which provides a flexible declarative mechanism for including hybrid services into a SPARQL federation.\n",

In this paper, we present HTStore, a hash tree based system for fast storing and accessing large scale RDF data. The design of HTStore has three salient features. First, the compact design can effectively reduce the size of the indexes. Second, HTStore utilizes the hash function to significantly reduce the query time. Third, the proposed hash tree structure can easily adapt to the changes in data volume (e.g., data expansion). The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system can improve the query efficiency up to 21.3% compared with the representative RDF data management systems.\n",

      "We have developed a method to canonicalise (aka. normalise) SPARQL queries with respect to query equivalence. Two queries are equivalent iff they return the same answers over any dataset. Our canonicalisation method deterministically rewrites a given input query to an equivalent canonical form such that the results for two queries are syntactically (string) equal if and only if they are equivalent. The process can also canonicalise variable names. Our canonicalisation method is sound and complete for a monotone fragment of SPARQL with selection (equalities), projection, join and union under both set and bag semantics. Considering other SPARQL features (e.g., optional, filter, graph, etc.), the underlying equivalence problem becomes undecidable, where we currently rather support a best-effort canonicalisation for other SPARQL 1.0. features The potential use-cases for such a canonicalisation procedure include caching, query log analysis, signing queries, query optimisation, etc. In the Poster and Demo session, we will demonstrate a prototype of our canonicalisation framework, provide example rewritings, and discuss limitations, potential use-cases and future directions.\n",
      "Caching in the context of expressive query languages such as SPARQL is complicated by the difficulty of detecting equivalent queries: deciding if two conjunctive queries are equivalent is npc, where adding further query features makes the problem undecidable. Despite this complexity, in this paper we propose an algorithm that performs syntactic canonicalisation of SPARQL queries such that the answers for the canonicalised query will not change versus the original. We can guarantee that the canonicalisation of two queries within a core fragment of SPARQL (monotone queries with select, project, join and union) is equal if and only if the two queries are equivalent; we also support other SPARQL features but with a weaker soundness guarantee: that the (partially) canonicalised query is equivalent to the input query. Despite the fact that canonicalisation must be harder than the equivalence problem, we show the algorithm to be practical for real-world queries taken from SPARQL endpoint logs, and further show that it detects more equivalent queries than when compared with purely syntactic methods. We also present the results of experiments over synthetic queries designed to stress-test the canonicalisation method, highlighting difficult cases.\n",
      "Blank nodes in RDF graphs can be used to represent existential values known to exist but whose identity remains unknown. A prominent example of such usage can be found in the Wikidata dataset where, e.g., the author of Beowulf is given as a blank node. However, while SPARQL considers blank nodes in a query as existentials, it treats blank nodes in data more like constants. Running SPARQL queries over datasets with unknown values thus may lead to uncertain results, which may make the SPARQL semantics unsuitable for datasets with existential blank nodes. We thus explore the feasibility of an alternative SPARQL semantics based on certain answers. In order to estimate the performance costs that would be associated with such a change in semantics for current implementations, we adapt and evaluate approximation techniques proposed in a relational database setting for a core fragment of SPARQL. To further understand the impact that such a change in semantics may have on query solutions, we analyse how such a change would affect the results of user queries over Wikidata.\n"

We start with a succinct translation of a fragment of SPARQL into Relational Algebra (RA) that fully respects bag semantics and three-valued logic. This translation relies on extensive use of the LEFT JOIN operator and coalesce function.  We then propose a number of optimisation techniques for reducing the size and improving the structure of generated SQL queries.

We first project the RDF graph into a continuous vector space by an entity context preserving translational embedding model which is specially designed for SPARQL queries. Then, given a SPARQL query that returns an empty set, we partition it into several parts and compute approximate answers by leveraging RDF embeddings and the translation mechanism. We also generate logical and alternative queries for returned answers, which helps users recognize their expectations and refine the original query finally. To validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our framework, we conduct extensive experiments on the real-world RDF dataset.

Neptune supports both the Apache Tinkerpop Gremlin stack as well as the RDF/SPARQL W3C standards. Designed to support highly concurrent OLTP workloads over data graphs, ACID support is a key feature of Neptune. While the W3C SPARQL standard deliberately does not define transaction semantics for SPARQL query processing, we learned from our customers that transactional guarantees are crucial in the context of concurrent read-write workloads against the data graph. In this presentation, we sketch use cases in which transactional guarantees are essential to avoid data anomalies, highlight aspects in which graph data transaction requirements differ from transactional systems in classical relational databases, sketch the transactional guarantees provided by Amazon Neptune, and discuss implementation aspects of Neptune’s transaction system.\n",

      "Worst-case optimal multiway join algorithms have recently gained a lot of attention in the database literature. These algorithms not only offer strong theoretical guarantees in terms of efficiency, but have also been empirically demonstrated to significantly improve query runtimes for relational and graph databases. Despite these promising theoretical and practical results, however, the Semantic Web community has yet to adopt such techniques; to the best of our knowledge, no native RDF database currently supports such join algorithms, where in this paper we demonstrate that this should change. We propose a novel procedure for evaluating SPARQL queries based on an existing worst-case join algorithm called Leapfrog Triejoin. We propose an adaptation of this algorithm for evaluating SPARQL queries, and implement it in Apache Jena. We then present experiments over the Berlin SPARQL Benchmark, WatDiv, and a novel benchmark that we propose based on Wikidata that is designed to provide insights into join performance for a more diverse set of basic graph patterns. Our results show that with this new join algorithm, Apache Jena runs orders of magnitude faster than the base version and two other popular SPARQL engines: Virtuoso and Blazegraph. \n",
      "SHACL(ShapesConstraintLanguage)isaspecificationfordescribing and validating RDF graphs that has recently become a W3C recommendation. While the language is gaining traction in industry, the implementation of SHACL validators is still in an early stage. A first challenge comes from the fact that RDF graphs are often exposed as SPARQL endpoints, and therefore only accessible via queries, Another difficulty is the absence of guidelines about the way recursive constraints should be handled. In this paper, we provide practical algorithms for validating a graph against a SHACL schema, that can be executed over a SPARQL endpoint. The problem has been shown to be NP-hard for recursive constraints, so we propose a strategy in which we first evaluate a small number of SPARQL queries, and then use the results to build a set of propositional formulas that are then passed onto a SAT solver. Interestingly, we also show that the process can be further optimised when dealing with recursive but tractable fragments of SHACL, without the need for an external solver. Finally, we investigate the possibility of validating a graph through a single query for non-recursive constraints. Our claims are validated with real world datasets.\n",
      "Access to hundreds of knowledge bases has been made available on the Web through public SPARQL endpoints. Unfortunately, few endpoints publish descriptions of their content (e.g., using VoID). It is thus unclear how agents can learn about the content of a given SPARQL endpoint or, relatedly, find SPARQL endpoints with content relevant to their needs. This research investigates the feasibility of a system that gathers information about public SPARQL endpoints by querying them directly about their own content. With the advent of SPARQL 1.1 and features such as aggregates, it is now possible to specify queries whose results would form a detailed profile of the content of the endpoint, comparable with a large subset of VoID. In theory it would thus be feasible to build a rich centralised catalogue describing the content indexed by individual endpoints by issuing them SPARQL (1.1) queries; this catalogue could then be searched and queried by agents looking for endpoints with content they are interested in. In practice, however, the coverage of the catalogue is bounded by the limitations of public endpoints themselves: some may not support SPARQL 1.1, some may return partial responses, some may throw exceptions for expensive aggregate queries, etc. The goal is thus twofold: (i) using VoID as a bar, to empirically investigate the extent to which public endpoints can describe their own content, and (ii) to build and analyse the capabilities of a best-effort online catalogue of current endpoints based on the (partial) results collected.\n",
      "Recommender Systems (RS) benefit from the rich structured information contained in publicly available RDF-graphs. Not only the burden of extracting features from text is thereby alleviated, but also the interconnections in the graph have been proven to be useful. These allow one to find related items in the graph which do not necessarily share a large number of features, e.g. items from different domains. Thus, these graphs can be exploited to generate cross-domain recommendations, i.e. to recommend items using feedback provided in a different domain. To benefit from RDF's data model, RecSPARQL is proposed as an extension of SPARQL together with a system which evaluates such queries. Although this solution makes it possible to generate recommendations on top of arbitrary RDF-graphs, it is limited to single-domain recommendations. In this paper we present an extension of RecSPARQL's syntax and semantics for cross-domain recommendations. Our experiments on a very sparse dataset show that the added components can help to improve the quality of recommendations.\n",
      "Translating SPARQL to Spark SQL has been proposed to  achieve better scalability in query evaluation. Recent investigations show  that the database design to store the RDF-graph plays a significant role  in the performance, due to intrinsic characteristics of Spark’s computation model. The analysis points to the interesting fact that a Wide  Property Table (WPT), a single-table design with one row for each subject and one column for each property, has very nice properties for storing  RDF-graphs. In addition to WPT’s simplicity, SPARQL queries, in particular those with many joins on subjects, are translated to an efficient  Spark execution plan. We aim to extend WPT with inverse properties  to broaden this benefit to other kinds of queries. Thus, in this paper we  propose a framework which can leverage one or a combination of WPTs  extensions. Our experiments on a widely used benchmark reveals that a  combination of three different kinds of WPT together lead to the best  performance for almost all query types but the linear-shaped ones.\n"

This approach improves upon existing approaches in a number of ways. For example, it allows HTML data to be queried using the full flexibility of SPARQL and makes converted data automatically available in the Semantic Web.

However, the values in the RDF triples would be frequently recorded simply as the literal, and additional contextual information such as unit and format is often omitted, relying on consistent understanding of the context. In the wider context of the Web, it is generally not safe to make this assumption. The Context Interchange strategy provides a systematic approach for mediated data access in which semantic conflicts among heterogeneous data sources are automatically detected and reconciled by a context mediator. In this paper, we show that SPARQL queries that involve multiple RDF graphs originating from different contexts can be mediated in the way using the Context Interchange (COIN) Framework.\n",

      "The SPARQL Query Language for RDF and the SPARQL Protocol for RDF are implemented by a growing number of storage systems and are used within enterprise and open web settings. As SPARQL is taken up by the community there is a growing need for benchmarks to compare the performance of storage systems that expose SPARQL endpoints via the SPARQL protocol. Such systems include native RDF stores, systems that map relational databases into RDF, and SPARQL wrappers around other kinds of data sources. This paper introduces the Berlin SPARQL Benchmark (BSBM) for comparing the performance of these systems across architectures. The benchmark is built around an e-commerce use case in which a set of products is offered by different vendors and consumers have posted reviews about products. The benchmark query mix illustrates the search and navigation pattern of a consumer looking for a product.

We aim to assist users in building queries and running them to make use of RDF data that would otherwise be partially or completely hidden. In this paper, as an initial iteration of our efforts, we present four approaches to building SPARQL queries visually, based on two different categorizations: schema- based vs. instance-based and SELECT vs. CONSTRUCT queries. We present the used interfaces, visual languages and query generation methods associated to each of approaches as well as the autocompletion techniques for the instancebased query builders.\n",
      "As the data and ontology layers of the Semantic Web stack have achieved a certain level of maturity in standard recommendations such as RDF and OWL, the current focus lies on two related aspects. On the one hand, the definition of a suitable query language for RDF, SPARQL, seems to be close to candidate recommendation status within the W3C. The establishment of the Rules layer on top of the existing stack on the other hand marks the next step to be tackled, where especially languages with their roots in Logic Programming and Deductive Databases are receiving considerable attention. The purpose of this paper is threefold. First, we discuss the formal semantics of SPARQL extending recent results in several ways. Second, we provide translations from SPARQL to Datalog with stratified negation as failure. Third, we propose some useful and easy to implement extensions of SPARQL, based on this translation. As it turns out, the combination serves for direct implementations of SPARQL on top of existing rules engines as well as a basis for more general rules and query languages on top of RDF.\n",

Customized summary statistics for RDF data enable the selectivity estimation of joined triple patterns and the development of efficient heuristics. Using the Lehigh University Benchmark (LUMB) we evaluate the performance of the heuristics for the queries provided by the LUBM and discuss some of them in more details.\n",
      "Easy reuse and integration of declaratively described information in a distributed setting is one of the main motivations for building the Semantic Web. Despite of this claim, reuse and recombination of RDF data today is mostly done using data replication and procedural code. A simple declarative mechanism for reusing and combining RDF data would help users to generate content for the semantic web. Having such a mechanism, the Semantic Web could better benefit from user generated content, as it is broadly present in the so called Web 2.0, but also from better linkage of existing content.  We propose Networked Graphs, which allow users to define RDF graphs both, by extensionally listing content, but also by using views on other graphs. These views can be used to include parts of other graphs, to transform data before including it and to denote rules.  The relationships between graphs are described declaratively using  SPARQL queries and an extension of the SPARQL semantics. Networked  Graphs are easily exchangeable between and interpretable on  different computers. Using existing protocols, Networked Graphs can  be evaluated in a distributed setting.\n"

      "The problem of answering SPARQL queries over virtual SPARQL views is commonly encountered in a number of settings, including while enforcing security policies to access RDF data, or when integrating RDF data from disparate sources. We approach this problem by rewriting SPARQL queries over the views to equivalent queries over the underlying RDF data, thus avoiding the costs entailed by view materialization and maintenance. We show that SPARQL query rewriting combines the most challenging aspects of rewriting for the relational and XML cases: like the relational case, SPARQL query rewriting requires synthesizing multiple views; like the XML case, the size of the rewritten query is exponential to the size of the query and the views. In this paper, we present the first native query rewriting algorithm for SPARQL. For an input SPARQL query over a set of virtual SPARQL views, the rewritten query resembles a union of conjunctive queries and can be of exponential size. We propose optimizations over the basic rewriting algorithm to (i) minimize each conjunctive query in the union; (ii) eliminate conjunctive queries with empty results from evaluation; and (iii) efficiently prune out big portions of the search space of empty rewritings. The experiments, performed on two RDF stores, show that our algorithms are scalable and independent of the underlying RDF stores. Furthermore, our optimizations have order of magnitude improvements over the basic rewriting algorithm in both the rewriting size and evaluation time.\n",

Also, it maintains a list of alternative ride givers so as to almost guarantee a ride for the ride taker. This solution uses a SPARQL-based continuous query framework that is capable of sensing fast-changing real-time situation. It also has reasoning capabilities for handling ride taker's preferences.

      "SPARQL -the standard query language for querying RDF- provides only limited navigational functionalities, although these features are of fundamental importance for graph data formats such as RDF. This has led the W3C to include the property path feature in the upcoming version of the standard, SPARQL 1.1. In this paper, we test several implementations of SPARQL 1.1 handling property path queries, and conclude that their evaluation methods for this class of queries perform so poorly that they cannot be used in practice. To formally explain this fact, we conduct a theoretical study of the computational complexity of property paths evaluation. Our results imply that the poor performance of the tested implementations is not a problem of these particular systems, but of the specification itself. In fact, we show that any implementation that adheres to the SPARQL 1.1 specification (as of November 2011) is doomed to show the same behavior, being the key issue the need for counting solutions imposed by the current specification.  We provide several intractability results, that together with our empirical results, provide strong evidence against the current semantics of SPARQL 1.1 property paths. Finally, we put our results in perspective, and propose a natural alternative semantics with tractable evaluation, that we think may lead to a wide adoption of the language by practitioners, developers and theoreticians.\n",

These patterns are used to extract instance knowledge from natural-language text. This knowledge is finally fed back into the Data Web, therewith closing the loop. The approach followed by BOA is quasi independent of the language in which the corpus is written. We demonstrate our approach by applying it to four different corpora and two different languages. We evaluate BOA on these data sets using DBpedia as background knowledge. Our results show that we can extract several thousand new facts in one iteration with very high accuracy.

      "This paper presents a framework for the reuse and extension of existing, established vocabularies in the Semantic Web. Driven by the primary application of expert finding, we will explore the reuse of vocabularies that have attracted a considerable user community already (FOAF, SIOC, etc.) or are derived from de facto standards used in tools or industrial practice (such as vCard, iCal and Dublin Core). This focus guarantees direct applicability and low entry barriers, unlike when devising a new ontology from scratch. The Web is already populated with several vocabularies which complement each other (but also have considerable overlap) in that they cover a wide range of necessary features to adequately describe the expert finding domain. Little effort has been made so far to identify and compare existing approaches, and to devise best practices on how to use and extend various vocabularies conjointly. It is the goal of the recently started ExpertFinder initiative to fill this gap. In this paper we present the ExpertFinder framework for reuse and extension of existing vocabularies in the Semantic Web. We provide a practical analysis of overlaps and options for combined use and extensions of several existing vocabularies as well as a proposal for applying rules and other enabling technologies to the expert finding task.\n",
      "We introduce domain-restricted RDF (dRDF) which allows to associate an RDF graph with a fixed, finite domain that interpretations for it may range over. We show that dRDF is a real extension of RDF and discuss impacts on the complexity of entailment in dRDF. The entailment problem represents the key reasoning task for RDF and is well known to be NP-complete. Remarkably, we show that the restriction of domains in dRDF raises the complexity of entailment from NP- to $\\Pi^P_2$-completeness. In order to lower complexity of entailment for both domain-restricted and unrestricted graphs, we take a closer look at the graph structure. For cases where the structure of RDF graphs is restricted via the concept of bounded treewidth, we manage to prove tractability of entailment. We also present a polynomial entailment checking algorithm for such graphs.\n",
      "Many science archive centres publish very large volumes of image, simulation, and experiment data. In order to integrate and analyse the available data, scientists need to be able to (i) identify and locate all the data relevant to their work; (ii) understand the multiple heterogeneous data models in which the data is published; and (iii) interpret and process the data they retrieve. RDF has been shown to be a generally successful framework within which to perform such data integration work. It can be equally successful in the context of scientific data, if it is demonstrably practical to expose that data as RDF.   In this paper we investigate the capabilities of RDF to enable the integration of scientific data sources. Specifically, we discuss the suitability of SPARQL for expressing scientific queries, and the performance of several triple stores and RDB2RDF tools for executing queries over a moderately sized sample of a large astronomical data set. We found that more research and improvements are required into SPARQL and RDB2RDF tools to efficiently expose existing science archives for data integration.\n",
      "More and more applications use the RDF framework as their data model and RDF stores to index and retrieve their data. Many of these applications require both structured queries as well as fulltext search. SPARQL addresses the first requirement in a standardized way, while fulltext search is provided by store-specific implementations. RDF benchmarks enable developers to compare structured query performance of different stores, but for fulltext search on RDF data no such benchmarks and comparisons exist so far. In this paper, we extend the LUBM benchmark with synthetic scalable fulltext data and corresponding queries for fulltext-related query performance evaluation. Based on the extended benchmark, we provide a detailed comparison of fulltext search features and performance of the most widely used RDF stores. Results show interesting RDF store insights for basic fulltext queries (classic IR queries) as well as hybrid queries (structured and fulltext queries). Our results are not only valuable for selecting the right RDF store for specific applications, but also reveal the need for performance improvements for certain kinds of queries.\n",
      "The Linking Open Data community project is promoting the creation of interlinked RDF datasets with links between data items identified using dereferenceable URIs. This promising direction for publishing data on the web brings forward a number of issues. A key challenge is to understand the data, the schema, and the interlinks that are actually used both within and across linked datasets. Understanding actual RDF usage is critical in the increasingly common situations where terms from many different  RDFS and OWL vocabularies are mixed.  In this paper we propose a novel mechanism to describe RDF usage by creating RDF summaries from bisimulation contractions of neighbourhoods (or BCNs).  We describe a tool, ExpLOD, that supports constructing and visualizing BCNs, as well as generating SPARQL queries based on the BCNs. We use ExpLOD to describe RDF usage within several of the collections from the Linked Open Data cloud. We present a performance evaluation of graph and SPARQL-based BCN implementations.\n",
      "The sizes of datasets available as RDF (e.g., as part of the Linked Data cloud) are increasing continuously. For instance, the recent DBpedia version consists of nearly 500 millions triples. A common strategy to avoid problems that arise e.g., from limited network connectivity or lack of bandwidth is to replicate data locally, therefore making them accessible for applications without depending on a network connection. For mobile devices with limited capabilities, however, the replication and synchronization of billions of triples is not feasible. To overcome this problem, we propose an approach to replicate parts of an RDF graph to a client. Applications may then apply changes to this partial replica while being offline; these changes are written back to the original data source upon reconnection. Our approach does not require any kind of additional logic (e.g., change logging) or data structures on the client side, and hence is suitable to be applied on devices with limited computing power and storage capacity.\n",
      "in the Linked Open Data cloud one of the largest data sets, comprising of 2.5 billion triples, is derived from the Life Science domain. Yet this represents a small fraction of the total number of publicly available data sources on the Web. In this paper, we briefly describe past attempts to transform specific Life Science sources from a plethora of open as well as proprietary formats into RDF data. In particular, we identify and tackle two bottlenecks in current practice: Acquiring ontologies to formally describe these data and creating RDFizer programs to convert data from legacy formats into RDF. We propose an unsupervised method, based on transformation rules, for performing these two key tasks, which makes use of our previous work on unsupervised wrapper induction for extracting labelled data from complete Life Science Web sites. We apply our approach to 13 real-world online Life Science databases. The learned ontologies are evaluated by domain experts as well as against gold standard ontologies. Furthermore, we compare the learned ontologies against ontologies that are “lifted” directly from the underlying relational schema using an existing unsupervised approach. Finally, we apply our approach to three online databases to extract RDF data. Our results indicate that this approach can be used to bootstrap and speed up the migration of life science data into the Linked Open Data cloud.\n"

      "The use of natural language identiﬁers as reference for ontology elements—in addition to the URIs required by the Semantic Web standards—is of utmost importance based on their predominance in the human everyday life, i.e. speech or print media. Depending on the context, different names can be chosen for one and the same element, and the same element can be referenced by different names. Here homonymy and synonymy are the main cause of the appearance of ambiguity in perceiving which concrete unique ontology element ought to be referenced by a speciﬁc natural language identiﬁer describing an entity. We propose a novel method to resolve entity references under the aspect of ambiguity which explores only formal background knowledge represented in RDF graph structures. The key idea of our domain independent approach is to build an entity network with the most likely referenced ontology elements by constructing spanning graphs based on spreading activation (SA). Additional to the exploitation of complex graph structures we devise a new ranking technique that characterises the likelihood of entities in  this network, i.e. interpretation contexts. Experiments in a highly polysemic domain show the ability of the algorithm to retrieve the correct ontology elements in almost all cases.\n",
      "Skyline queries are a class of preference queries that are valuable for multi-criteria decision making scenarios. Such queries compute the pareto-optimal tuples from a set of tuples. This problem has received significant attention in the context of relational data where many techniques focus on answering queries over a single table. Consequently, for multi-relational skyline query scenarios, as would be the norm for RDF, the strategy for query evaluation would need to be a join-first-skyline-later strategy. However, such a split computational strategy limits the optimization opportunities that are useful for pruning search space via information passing between the join phase and the skyline phase. Other available techniques for multi-relational skyline queries assume storage and indexing techniques that are not typically used with RDF, thereby requiring a preprocessing step. In this paper, we present an approach for optimizing skyline queries over RDF data. The approach is based on the concept of a “Header Point” which maintains a concise summary of visited region in the data space. This summary allows some fraction of non-skyline tuples to be pruned from the set advancing to the skyline processing phase, thus reducing the number of expensive dominance checks required in the skyline phase. We further present more aggressive pruning rules that result in the computation of near-complete skylines in significantly less time than the complete algorithm. A comprehensive performance evaluation of different algorithms is presented using datasets with different types of data distributions generated using a benchmark data generator.\n",
      "There are several applications that provide access to objects whose descriptions are accompanied by a degree expressing their strength. Such degrees can have various application specific semantics, such as relevance, precision,  certainty,  trust, etc. In this paper we consider Fuzzy RDF as the representation framework for such \"weighted\" descriptions, and we propose a novel model for interactively browsing and exploring such sources which allows formulating complex queries by simple clicks. Specifically, and in order to exploit the fuzzy degrees, the model proposes interval-based transition markers. The advantage of the model is that it significantly increases the discrimination power of the interaction, without making it complex for the end user.\n",
      "Processing a join operation using MapReduce platforms such as Hadoop incurs communication and I/O costs due to data transfer between the Map and Reduce phases. This cost is prohibitive for RDF graph patterns which typically involve several joins. Existing approaches on optimizing RDF graph pattern matching exploit the existence of star-join structures in RDF graph patterns and propose the use of bushy query execution plans instead of linear ones. However, some Hadoop-based data processing systems such as Yahoo’s Pig only support linear execution plans, and require significant modifications to the scheduler to support bushy plans. In this paper, we propose an approach for “sneaking in” bushy query execution plans into Hadoop by interpreting star joins as “groups of triples” known as TripleGroups. We present an alternative intermediate TripleGroup-based algebra called the Nested Triple Group Algebra (NTGA) for rewriting star-join queries as TripleGroup queries. We also propose a data representation format (RDFMap) that more efficiently supports TripleGroup-based processing than the existing relational tuple infrastructure. We present a comparative performance evaluation of the traditional Pig approach and RAPID+ (Pig extended with NTGA) for graph pattern matching queries on the BSBM benchmark dataset. Results show over 60% performance of our approach over traditional Pig for some tasks.\n",

The bind operation runs concurrently in all the data slices allowing the reasoning to be processed in parallel among the cluster. Throughout this paper we provide detailed descriptions of the architecture, reasoning algorithms, and a scalability evaluation with the LUBM benchmark. 4sr is a stable tool available under a GNU GPL3 license and can be freely used and extended by the community.\n",
      "The amount of semantic data available as RDF is large and increasing. Despites the increased awareness that exploiting this large amount of data requires not only logic-based reasoning but also statistics-based inference capabilities, only little work can be found for the latter. On semantic data, supervised approaches particularly kernel-based Support Vector Machines (SVM) are promising. However, obtaining the right features to be used in kernels is an open problem because the amount of features that can be extracted from the complex structure of semantic data might very large. Further, instead of a single one, combining several kernels that specialize on subsets of features can help to deal with eciency and data sparsity. This creates the additional problem of identifying and combining dierent subset of features and kernels, respectively. In this work, we solve these two problems by employing the strategy of dynamic propositionalization to compute a hypothesis, representing the relevant features for a set of examples. Then, an R-convolution kernel is obtained from a set of clause kernels derived from components of the hypothesis. The learning of the hypothesis and kernel(s) is performed in an interleaving fashion, using a coevolution-based genetic algorithm for the underlying problem of multi-objective optimization. Based on experiments on real-world datasets, we show that the resulting relational kernel machine improves the SVM baseline\n",
      "The emergence of the Semantic Web has led to the creation of large semantic knowledge bases, often in the form of RDF databases. Improving the performance of RDF databases necessitates the development of specialized data management techniques, such as the use of shortcuts in the place of path queries. In this paper we deal with the problem of selecting the most beneficial shortcuts that reduce the execution cost of path queries in RDF databases given a space constraint. We first demonstrate that this problem is an instance of the quadratic knapsack problem. Given the computational complexity of solving such problems, we then develop an alternative formulation based on a bi-criterion linear relaxation, which essentially seeks to minimize a weighted sum of the query cost and of the required space consumption. As we demonstrate in this paper, this relaxation leads to very efficient classes of linear programming solutions. We utilize this bi-criterion linear relaxation in an algorithm that selects a subset of shortcuts to materialize. This shortcut selection algorithm is extensively evaluated and compared with a greedy algorithm that we developed in prior work. The reported experiments show that the linear relaxation algorithm manages to significantly reduce the query execution times, while also outperforming the greedy solution.\n"

      "This paper proposes to apply the RDF framework to the representation of linguistic annotations.  We argue that RDF is a suitable data model to capture multiple annotations on the same text segment, and to integrate multiple layers of annotations. Besides the idea of using RDF for this purpose, the main contribution of the paper is an OWL ontology, called TELIX (Text Encoding and Linguistic Information eXchange), which models  annotation content.  This ontology builds on the SKOS~XL vocabulary, a W3C standard for lexical entities representation as RDF graphs. We extend SKOS in order to capture lexical relations between words (e.g., synonymy), as well as to support word sense disambiguation, morphological features and syntactic analysis, among others. Additionally, a formal mapping of feature structures to RDF graphs is defined, enabling complex composition of linguistic entities. Finally, the paper also suggests the use of RDFa as a convenient syntax that combines source texts and linguistic annotations in the same file.\n",
      "Huge RDF datasets are currently exchanged on textual RDF formats, hence consumers need to post-process them through RDF stores for local consumption, such as reasoning/integration and  SPARQL query. This results in a painful task which requires a great effort in terms of time and computational resources. A first approach to lightweight data exchange is a compact (binary) RDF serialization format called HDT. In this paper, we focus on enhancing the exchanged data in order to optimize the consumption without the need of  \"unpacking\" the data. This is done by post-processing the HDT, enhancing the data with additional structures which allow basic forms of SPARQL queries. Experiments show that i) with an exchanging efficiency that outperforms universal compression, ii) post-processing now becomes a fast process which iii) provides competitive query performance at consumption.\n",
      "The increasing availability of structured data in Resource Description Framework (RDF) format poses new challenges and opportunities for data mining. Existing approaches to mining RDF have focused on one specific data representation, one specific machine learning algorithm or one specific task, only. Kernels, however, promise a more flexible approach by providing a powerful framework for decoupling the data representation from the learning task. This paper focuses on how the well established family of kernel-based machine learning algorithms can be readily applied to instances represented as RDF graphs. We first review the problems that arise when conventional graph kernels are used for RDF graphs. We then introduce two versatile families of RDF graph kernels based on intersection graphs and intersection trees. These kernels can better exploit the inherent properties of RDF, while providing an easy to use interface between any RDF graph (including vocabulary extensions such as RDFS and OWL) and any kernel-based learning algorithm (which are available for solving many machine learning tasks). The flexibility of the approach is demonstrated on two common relational learning tasks: entity classification and link prediction. The results show that our novel RDF graph kernels with standard SVMs achieve competitive predictive performance when compared to specialized techniques for both tasks.\n",
      "The amount of structured data is growing rapidly. Given a structured query that asks for some entities, the number of matching candidate results is often very high. The problem of ranking these results has gained attention. Because results in this setting equally and perfectly match the query, existing ranking approaches often use features that are independent of the query. A popular one is based on the notion of centrality that is derived via PageRank. In this paper, we adopt learning to rank approach to this structured query setting, provide a systematic categorization of query-independent features that can be used for that, and finally, discuss how to leverage information in access logs to automatically derive the training data needed for learning. In experiments using real-world datasets and human evaluation based on crowd sourcing, we show the superior performance of our approach over two relevant baselines.\n",
      "In this paper, we argue that query relaxation over RDF data is an important but largely overlooked research topic: the Semantic Web standards allow for answering crisp queries over crisp data, but what of use-cases that require approximate answers for structured queries over RDF data? We introduce one such use-case extracted from an EADS project that aims to fuse together intelligence information for police post-incident analysis. The concrete application for query relaxation involves matching (possibly vague) descriptions of entities involved in crimes to structured descriptions thereof in the database. Here, the core research questions are: (i) how can we formalise potentially vague structured queries in a generic manner; (ii) how can we support approximate, structured query-answering over RDF? We first discuss the use-case, formalise the problem, and survey current literature for possible approaches.  Next, we present a proof-of-concept framework for enabling relaxation of structured entity-lookup queries, evaluating different distance measures for performing relaxation. We argue that, beyond our specific use-case, query relaxation is important to many potential use-cases for Semantic Web techniques, and worthy of further attention.\n",

These maps turn out to be suitable for reasoning about similarities in information content between two or more RDF graphs. As such they are very useful e.g. for migrating data from one RDF vocabulary to another. In this paper we address a particular instance of this problem and try to provide an answer to the question of when we are licensed to say that data is being transformed, reused or merged in a non-distortive manner. We place this problem in the context of RDF and Linked Data, and study the problem in relation to SPARQL construct queries.\n",

      "Information on the temporal interval of validity for facts described by RDF triples         plays an important role in a large number of applications. Yet, most of the knowledge bases         available on the Web of Data do not provide such information in an explicit manner. In this         paper, we present a generic approach which addresses this drawback by inserting temporal         information into knowledge bases. Our approach combines two types of information to         associate RDF triples with time intervals. First, it relies on temporal information gathered         from the document Web by an extension of the fact validation framework DeFacto. Second, it         harnesses the time information contained in knowledge bases. This knowledge is combined         within a three-step approach which comprises the steps matching, selection and merging. We         evaluate our approach against a corpus of facts gathered from Yago2 by using DBpedia and         Freebase as input and different parameter settings for the underlying algorithms.

The         distributed nature of the Semantic Web demands query processing techniques to evolve towards         a scenario where data is scattered on distributed data stores. Existing approaches to         keyword search cannot guarantee scalability in a distributed environment, because, at         runtime, they are unaware of the location of the relevant data to the query and thus, they         cannot optimize join tasks.

Blank nodes are used for various purposes (e.g. for describing complex attributes),         and a significant percentage of resources is currently represented with blank nodes.         Moreover, several semantic data management tasks, like isomorphism checking (useful for         checking equivalence), and blank node matching (useful in         comparison/versioning/synchronization, and in semantic similarity functions), not only have         to deal with blank nodes, but their complexity and optimality depends on the connectivity of         blank nodes.

      "Indented tree has been widely used to organize information and visualize graph-structured data like RDF graphs. Given a starting resource in a cyclic RDF graph, there are different ways of transforming the graph into a tree representation to be visualized as an indented tree. It would be interesting to investigate whether and how these different representations influence the user's browsing experience. In this paper, we address this issue from the coherence aspect of tree representation. We aim to smooth the user's reading experience by visualizing an optimal indented tree in the sense of featuring the fewest reversed edges, which often cause confusion and interrupt the user's cognitive process due to lack of a general, effective way of presentation. To achieve this, we propose a two-step approach that is theoretically proved to generate such an optimal tree representation for a given RDF graph and a specified starting resource. We also empirically show the difference in coherence between tree representations of real-world RDF graphs generated by our approach and two baseline approaches that have been widely adopted. These different tree representations lead to significantly different user experience in our preliminary user study, which reports a considerable degree of dependence between coherence and user experience.\n",
      "In the context of Web of Things (WoT), embedded networks have to face the challenge of getting ever more complex. The complexity arises as the number of interchanging heterogeneous devices and different hardware resource classes always increase. When it comes to the development and the use of embedded networks in the WoT domain, Semantic Web technologies are seen as one way to tackle this complexity. For example, properties and capabilities of embedded devices may be semantically described in order to enable an effective search over different classes of devices, semantic integration may be deployed to integrate data produced by these devices, or embedded devices may be empowered to reason about semantic data in the context of a WoT application. Despite these possibilities, a wide adoption of Semantic Web or Linked Data technologies in the domain of embedded networks has not been established yet. One reason for this is an inefficient representation of semantic data. Serialisation formats of RDF data, such as for instance a plain-text XML, are not suitable for embedded devices. \n",
      "In this paper, we present an approach that enables constrained devices, such as microcontrollers with very limited hardware resources, to store and process semantic data. Our approach is based on the W3C Efficient XML Interchange (EXI) format. To show the applicability of the approach, we provide an EXI-based RDF Store and show associated evaluation results.\n",

To this direction ontology summarization aspires to produce an abridged version of the original ontology that highlights the most representative concepts of it. In this paper, we present RDF Digest, a novel platform that automatically produces summaries of RDF/S Knowledge Bases. In our work, a summary is a valid RDF/S document that includes the most representative concepts of the schema adapted to the corre-sponding data instances. To construct this graph our algorithm exploits the se-mantics and the structure of the schema and the distribution of the corresponding data/instances as well. The performed evaluation demonstrates the benefits of our approach and the considerable advantages gained.\n",

FAGI-gis is the core component of the FAGI framework, which handles all the steps of the fusion process of two interlinked RDF datasets in order to produce an integrated, aligned and richer dataset that combines data and metadata from both initial datasets. In the demonstation, we showcase how a user can use FAGI-gis’s map based UI to perform several fusion actions on linked geospatial entities, considering both spatial and non-spatial properties of them.\n",
      "While individual components for semantic data integration are commonly available, end-to-end solutions are rare. We demonstrate DataOps, a seamless Anything-to-RDF semantic data integration toolkit. DataOps supports the integration of both semantic and non-semantic data from an extensible host of different formats. Setting up data sources end-to-end works in three steps: (1) accessing the data from arbitrary locations in different formats, (2) specifying map- pings depending on the data format (e.g., R2RML for relational data), and (3) consolidating new data with existing data instances (e.g., by establishing owl:sameAs links). All steps are supported through a fully integrated Web interface with configuration forms and different mapping editors. Visitors of the demo will be able to perform all three steps of the integration process.\n",
      "With the adoption of RDF across several domains come growing requirements pertaining to the completeness and quality of RDF datasets. Currently, this problem is most commonly addressed by manually devising means to enriching an input dataset. The few tools that aim at supporting this endeavour usually focus on supporting the manual definition of enrichment pipelines. In this paper, we present a supervised learning approach based on a refinement operator for enriching RDF datasets. We show how we can use exemplary descriptions of enriched resources to generate accurate enrichment pipelines. We evaluate our approach against 8 manually defined enrichment pipelines and show that our approach can learn accurate pipelines even when provided with a small number of training examples.\n",

      "While previous work on query relaxation over RDF data have focused on defining new relaxation operators, in this paper techniques to find the parts of an RDF query which are responsible of its failure, are investigated. Finding such subqueries, named Minimal Failing Subqueries (MFS), is of great interest to efficiently perform the relaxation process. We propose two algorithmic approaches inspired by previous work conducted in the context of relational databases. The first approach (called LBA) intelligently leverages the lattice of subqueries of the initial RDF query\n",
      "while the second (called MBA) is based on a particular matrix that can be used to improve the performance of LBA. In addition, we also show  how our approaches can compute maximal non-failing subqueries, called Maximal Success Subqueries (XSS). XSSs are subqueries with maximal number of triple patterns of the initial query that result in non-empty answers. To validate our approaches, a set of thorough experiments is conducted on the LUBM benchmark and a comparative study with other approaches is done.\n",

Digital music is broadly used today in many professional music production environments. For decades, MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) has been the standard for digital music exchange between musicians and devices, albeit not in a Web friendly way. Here, we show the potential of expressing digital music as Linked Data, using our midi2rdf suite of tools to convert and stream digital music in MIDI format to RDF. The conversion allows for lossless round tripping: we can reconstruct a MIDI file identical to the original using its RDF representation. The streaming uses a novel generative audio matching algorithm that enables us to broadcast, with very low latency, RDF triples describing MIDI events coming from arbitrary analog instruments.\n"

      "Many solutions have been developed to convert data to RDF. A common task during this conversion is applying data manipulation functions to obtain the desired output. Depending on the data format, one can rely on the underlying technology, such as RDBMS for relational databases or XQuery for XML, to manipulate – to a certain extent – the data while generating RDF. For CSV files, however, there is no such underlying technology. One has to resort to pre- or post-processing techniques when data manipulation is needed, which renders the process of generating RDF more complex (in terms of number of steps), and therefore also less traceable and transparent. Another solution is to declare functions in mappings. KR2RML provides data manipulation functions as part of the mapping, but due to its complex format, it is difficult to create or maintain mappings without their editor. In this paper, we propose a method to incorporate functions into mapping languages in a more amenable way. \n",

In this paper we propose a di erent approach for querying RDF streams over ontologies, based on the combination of query rewriting and stream processing. We show that it is possible to rewrite continuous queries over streams of RDF data, while maintaining e - ciency for a wide range of scenarios. We provide a detailed description of our approach, as well as an implementation, StreamQR, which is based on the kyrie rewriter, and can be coupled with a native RSP engine, namely CQELS.

Typing (assigning a class selected from schema) information can be attached to URI resources in RDF/S knowledge graphs and datasets to improve quality, reliability, and analysis. There are two types of properties: object properties, and datatype properties. Type information can be made available for object properties as their object values are URIs. Typed object properties allow richer semantic analysis compared to datatype properties, whose object values are literals. In fact, many datatype properties can be analyzed to suggest types selected from a schema similar to object properties, enabling their wider use in applications. In this paper, we propose an approach to glean types for datatype properties by processing their object values. We show the usefulness of generated types by utilizing them to group facts on the basis of their semantics in computing diversified entity summaries by extending a state-of-the-art summarization algorithm.\n",

Most of the previous work on RDF query relaxation compute a set of relaxed queries and execute them in a similarity-based ranking order. Thus, these approaches relax an RDF query without knowing its Failure Causes (FCs). In this paper, we study the interest of identifying these FCs to speed up the query relaxation process. We propose three relaxation strategies based on various information levels about the FCs of the user query and of its relaxed queries as well.

The main difference is that, when an instance is created, the user has a chance of looking for a pre-existing URI for the corresponding individual in a publicly available service called OKKAM. The match between the newly created instance and the stored individuals is based on an algorithm which compares the features of the new isntance with a simple profile stored in OKKAM for all individuals.

      "In this paper we describe RDFSync, a methodology for efficient synchronization and merging of RDF models. RDFSync is based on decomposing a model into Minimum Self-Contained graphs (MSGs). After illustrating theory and deriving properties of MSGs, we show how a RDF model can be represented by a list of hashes of such information fragments. The synchronization procedure here described is based on the evaluation and remote comparison of these ordered lists. Experimental results show that the algorithm provides very significant savings on network traffic compared to the file-oriented synchronization of serialized RDF graphs. Finally, we provide the design and report the implementation of a protocol for executing the RDFSync algorithm over HTTP.\n",
      "An important open question in the semantic Web is the precise relationship between the RDF(S) semantics and the semantics of standard knowledge representation formalisms such as logic programming and description logics. In this paper we address this issue by considering embeddings of RDF and RDFS in logic. Using these embeddings, combined with existing results about various fragments of logic, we establish several novel complexity results. The embeddings we consider show how techniques from deductive databases and description logics can be used for reasoning with RDF(S). Finally, we consider querying RDF graphs and establish the data complexity of conjunctive querying for the various RDF entailment regimes.\n",
      "We study the problem of distributed RDFS reasoning and query answering on top of distributed hash tables. Scalable, distributed RDFS reasoning is an essential functionality for providing the scalability and performance that large-scale Semantic Web applications require. Our goal in this paper is to compare and evaluate two well-known approaches to RDFS reasoning, namely backward and forward chaining, on top of distributed hash tables. We show how to implement both algorithms on top of the distributed hash table Bamboo and prove their correctness. We also study the time-space trade-off exhibited by the algorithms analytically, and experimentally by evaluating our algorithms on PlanetLab.\n",
      "We describe RDF123, a highly flexible open-source tool for translating spreadsheet data to RDF. Existing spreadsheet-to-rdf tools typically map only to star-shaped RDF graphs, i.e. each spreadsheet row is an instance, with each column representing a property. RDF123, on the other hand, allows users to define mappings to arbitrary graphs, thus allowing much richer spreadsheet semantics to be expressed.  Further, each row in the spreadsheet can be mapped with a fairly different RDF scheme. Two interfaces are available. The first is a graphical application that allows users to create their mapping in an intuitive manner. The second is a Web service that takes as input a URL to a Google spreadsheet or CSV file and an RDF123 map file, and provides RDF as output.\n",
      "We present a technique for answering queries over RDF data through an evolutionary search algorithm, using fingerprinting and bloomfilters for rapid approximate evaluation of generated solutions.  Our evolutionary approach has several advantages compared to traditional database-style query answering.  First, the result quality increases monotonically and converges with each evolution, offering ``anytime'' behaviour with arbitrary trade-off between computation time and query results; in addition, the level of approximation can be tuned by varying the size of the bloomfilters.  Secondly, through bloomfilter compression we can fit large graphs in main memory, reducing the need for disk I/O during query evaluation.  Finally, since the individuals evolve independently, parallel execution is straightforward.  We present an initial prototype that evaluates basic SPARQL queries over arbitrary RDF graphs and show initial results over large datasets.\n",

      "In February, the W3C initiated the RDB2RDF Incubator Group chartered to set direction in the area on mapping Relational Databases to RDF.  In these few months we have made significant progress.  There is a substantial Wiki that catalogs existing tools and approaches and we have the start of a recommendation to the W3C for further work.  The poster session will discuss existing approaches to mapping Relational data to RDF and will entertain discussion on how to make progress in this area.\n",
      "With the advance of the Semantic Web technology, increasing data will be annotated with computer understandable structures (i.e. RDF and OWL), which allow us to use more expressive queries to improve our ability in information seeking. However, constructing a structured query is a laborious process, as a user has to master the query language as well as the underlying schema of the queried data. In this demo, we introduce SUITS4RDF, a novel interface for constructing structured queries for the Semantic Web. It allows users to start with arbitrary keyword queries and to enrich them incrementally with an arbitrary but valid structure, using computer suggested queries or query components. This interface allows querying the Semantic Web conveniently and efficiently, while enabling users to express their intent precisely.\n",
      "This poster session is about a new type of event database that makes it efficient to reason about things, people, companies, relationships between people and companies, and about places and events. This event database is built on top of a scalable distributed RDF triple store that can handle literally billions of events. Like objects, events have at least one actor, but usually more, a start-time and possibly an end-time, a place where the event happened, and the type of the event. An event can have many additional properties and annotations. For example, telephone call detail records, email records, financial transactions, purchases, hospital visits, insurance claims, library records, etc. can all be viewed as events. On top of this event database we implemented very efficient geospatial and temporal queries, an extensive social network analysis library and simplified description logic. This session describes the design and use of a unifying query framework for geospatial reasoning, temporal logic, social network analytics, RDFS and OWL in Event-Based systems.\n"

      "Despite the increasing popularity of RDF as a data  representation method, there is no accepted measure of the  importance of nodes in an RDF graph. Such a measure could be used to  sort the nodes returned by a SPARQL query or to find the important  concepts in an RDF graph. In this paper we propose a graph-theoretic  measure called noc-order for ranking nodes in RDF graphs based  on the notion of centrality. We illustrate that this method is able  to capture interesting global properties of the underlying RDF graph  using study cases from different knowledge domains. We also show how  well noc-order behaves even if the underlying data has some noise,  i.e. superfluous and/or erroneous data. Finally, we discuss how  information about the importance of different predicates either  based on their informativeness, prior semantic information about  them or user preferences can be incorporated into this measure. We  show the effects of such modifications to the ranking method by  examples.\n",

This homepage separates the content from the model allowing users to customise the view of the homepage without editing its content. We decided to take this idea further and immerse it in the world of Web 2.0 technologies: through the union between Semantic Web and Web 2.0 technologies we provide ease of use to average users via powerful but simplistic Web 2.0 interfaces. We overhauled the architecture of the original RDFHomepage and focused on a modular structure which included many standard Web 2.0 applications such as weblog, calendar and search.\n",
      "Nowadays, more and more URIs reside on DataWeb, as published for linked open data, dereferencing URIs challenges the current Web to embrace Semantic Web. Although, quite a few practical recipes for publishing URIs have been provided to make URIs dereferencable, we believe a fundamental investigation of publishing and dereferencing URIs would contribute a forward compatibility with the RDF and OWL upper layers in the Semantic Web architecture. In this paper, we propose to make URIs published on Data Web RDF dereferencable, and we formalize such a requirement in an RDF-compatible semantics. Also, the dereferencing operation is defined in an abstract URI syntax, such that URIs, as interpreted as described resources, would be RDF dereferencable by default. Accompanied by a live demonstration, the poster demo explanation would elaborately discuss and seriously address issues on Data Web URIs, which were or have been taken for granted. Additionally, for case study, Metadata Web, a Data Web of enterprise-wide models, is explored. The URIs on Metadata Web is published as RDF dereferencable. Such an implementation of universal meta data management across the enterprise enables the metadata federation such that global query, search and analysis could be conducted on top of the Metadata Web.\n",
      "This poster proposes BitMat, a bit matrix structure for representing a large number of RDF triples in memory and processing conjunctive triple pattern (multi-join) queries using it. The compact in-memory storage and use of bitwise operations, can lead to a faster processing of join queries when compared to the conventional RDF triple stores. Unlike conventional RDF triple stores, where the size of the intermediate join results can grow very large, our BitMat based multi-join algorithm ensures that the intermediate result set remains small across any number of join operations (provided there are no Cartesian joins). We present the key concepts of BitMat structure, its use in processing join queries, describe the preliminary experimental results with UniProt and LUBM datasets, and discuss the possible use case scenarios.\n",

This simplifies the publication of sophisticated RDF data, i.e. such that goes beyond simple property-value pairs, by broad audiences. Also, it empowers users with access limited to inserting XHTML snippets within Web-based authoring systems to add fully-fledged RDF and even OWL.

This paper introduces the LexRDF model, which maps the LexGrid model elements to corresponding constructs in W3C speci¯cations such as RDF, OWL, and SKOS. With LexRDF, the terminological information represent in LexGrid can be translated to RDF triples, and therefore allowing LexGrid to leverage standard tools and technologies such as SPARQL and RDF triple stores.\n",
      "In this paper we present a method and an implementation for creating and processing semantic events from interaction with Web pages which opens possibilities to build event-driven applications for the (Semantic) Web. Events, simple or complex, are models for things that happen e.g., when a user interacts with a Web page. Events are consumed in some meaningful way e.g., for monitoring reasons or to trigger actions such as responses. In order for receiving parties to understand events e.g., comprehend what has led to an event, we propose a general event schema using RDFS. In this schema we cover the composition of complex events and event-to-event relationships. These events can then be used to route semantic information about an occurrence to different recipients helping in making the Semantic Web active. Additionally, we present an architecture for detecting and composing events in Web clients. For the contents of events we show a way of how they are enriched with semantic information about the context in which they occurred. The paper is presented in conjunction with the use case of Semantic Advertising, which extends traditional clickstream analysis by introducing semantic short-term profiling, enabling discovery of the current interest of a Web user and therefore supporting advertisement providers in responding with more relevant advertisements.\n",

Various ontologies and knowledge bases with millions of RDF triples from Wikipedia and other sources, mostly in e-science, have been created and are publicly available. Recording provenance information of RDF triples aggregated from different heterogeneous sources is crucial in order to effectively support trust mechanisms, digital rights and privacy policies. Managing provenance becomes even more important when we consider not only explicitly stated but also implicit triples (through RDFS inference rules) in conjunction with declarative languages for querying and updating RDF graphs. In this paper we rely on colored RDF triples represented as quadruples to capture and manipulate explicit provenance information.\n",

In this paper, we focus on languages allowing the formulation of concise and intuitive deltas, which are expressive enough to describe unambiguously any possible change and that can be effectively and efficiently detected. We propose a specific language that provably exhibits those characteristics and provide a change detection algorithm which is sound and complete with respect to the proposed language. Finally, we provide a promising experimental evaluation of our framework using real ontologies from the cultural and bioinformatics domains.\n"

      "RDF is an increasingly important paradigm for the representation of information on the Web. As RDF databases increase in size to approach tens of millions of triples, and as sophisticated graph matching queries expressible in languages like SPARQL become increasingly important, scalability becomes an issue. To date, there is no graph-based indexing method for RDF data where the index was designed in a way that makes it disk-resident. There is therefore a growing need for indexes that can operate efficiently when the index itself resides on disk. In this paper, we first propose the DOGMA index for fast subgraph matching on disk and then develop a basic algorithm to answer queries over this index. This algorithm is then significantly sped up via an optimized algorithm that uses efficient (but correct) pruning strategies when combined with two different extensions of the index. We have implemented a preliminary system and tested it against four existing RDF database systems developed by others. Our experiments show that our algorithm performs very well compared to these systems, with orders of magnitude improvements for complex graph queries.\n",

In this paper we present Tripcel, a tool that applies the spreadsheet concept to RDF. It allows users to formulate expressions over the contents of an RDF graph, to arrange these expressions in a grid, and to interactively inspect their evaluation results. Thus it can be used to perform analysis tasks over large data sets within an understandable and familiar interface.\n",

The widespread use and improved capabilities of portable devices enable the deployment of sophisticated and powerful applications that provide the user with services at any time and location.

Hence we propose a framework that uses RDF-based context descriptions to selectively and proactively replicate data to mobile devices. These replicas can be used when no network connection can be established, thus making mobile applications and users more autonomous and stable.\n",

Initial experiments are auspicious.\n",
      "In this paper, we consider the problem of materializing the complete finite RDFS closure in a scalable manner; this includes those parts of the RDFS closure that are often ignored such as literal generalization and container membership properties.

We show that the time to produce inferences scales linearly with the number of processes, evaluating this behavior on up to hundreds of millions of triples. We also show the number of inferences produced for different subsets of LUBM10k. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to provide RDFS inferencing on such large data sets in such low times. Finally, we discuss future work in terms of promising applications of this approach including OWL2RL rules, MapReduce implementations, and massive scaling on supercomputers.\n",
      "Hierarchical classifications are available for many domains of interest. They often provide a large amount of category definitions and some sort of hierarchies. Thanks to their size and popularity, they are a promising ground for publishing and organizing data on the Semantic Web. Unfortunately, classifications can mostly not be directly used as ontologies in OWL, because they are not (or at least: very bad) ontologies. In particular, the labels in categories often lack a context-neutral notion of what it means to be an instance of that category, and the meaning of the hierarchical relations is often not a strict subClassOf. SKOS2OWL is an online tool that allows deriving consistent RDF-S or OWL ontologies from most hierarchical classifications available in the W3C SKOS exchange format. SKOS2OWL helps the user narrow down the intended meaning of the available categories to classes and guides the user through several modeling choices. In particular, SKOS2OWL can draw a representative random sample of relevant conceptual elements in the SKOS file and asks the user to make statements about their meaning. This can be used to make reliable modeling decisions without looking at every single element, which would be unfeasible for large classifications.\n",

We vary the combination of different RDF graph matching paradigms with different machine learning classifiers and observe the effects on the classification of identity web references. We present preliminary results of an evaluation in order to show the variation in accuracy of these different permutations.\n",
      "RDF data are usually accessed using one of two methods: either, graphs are rendered in forms perceivable by human users (e.g., in tabular or in graphical form), which are difficult to handle for large data sets. Alternatively, query languages like SPARQL provide means to express information needs in structured form; hence they are targeted towards developers and experts. Inspired by the concept of spreadsheet tools, where users can perform relatively complex calculations by splitting formulas and values across multiple cells, we have investigated mechanisms that allow us to access RDF graphs in a more intuitive and manageable, yet formally grounded manner. In this paper, we make three contributions towards this direction. First, we present RDFunctions, an algebra that consists of mappings between sets of RDF language elements (URIs, blank nodes, and literals) under consideration of the triples contained in a background graph. Second, we define a syntax for expressing RDFunctions, which can be edited, parsed and evaluated. Third, we discuss Tripcel, an implementation of RDFunctions using a spreadsheet metaphor. Using this tool, users can easily edit and execute function expressions and perform analysis tasks on the data stored in an RDF graph.\n",
      "RDF Schema (RDFS) as a lightweight ontology language is gaining popularity and, consequently, tools for scalable RDFS inference and querying are needed. SPARQL has become recently a W3C standard for querying RDF data, but it mostly provides means for querying simple RDF graphs only, whereas querying with respect to RDFS or other entailment regimes is left outside the current specification. In this paper, we show that SPARQL faces certain unwanted ramifications when querying ontologies in conjunction with RDF datasets that comprise multiple named graphs, and we provide an extension for SPARQL that remedies these effects. Moreover, since RDFS inference has a close relationship with logic rules, we generalize our approach to select a custom ruleset for specifying inferences to be taken into account in a SPARQL query. We show that our extensions are technically feasible by providing benchmark results for RDFS querying in our prototype system GiaBATA, which uses Datalog coupled with a persistent Relational Database as a back-end for implementing SPARQL with dynamic rule-based inference. By employing different optimization techniques like magic set rewriting our system remains competitive with state-of-the-art RDFS querying systems.\n"

In contrast, the schema-based approaches relying on the reduced summary graph require much less processing time but cannot always generate correct answers.

For more advanced and domain-specific evolution and refactorings, several simple evolution patterns can be combined into a compound one.

In this abstract we present a framework which visualises RDF graphs in a native browser environment, leveraging both the SVG standard and JavaScript technology to provide a responsive user interface.

On-demand management operations can be implemented on top of HDT representation.

In order to fully exploit these new avenues of performance improvement, computationally expensive workloads have to be expressed in a way that allows for fine-grained parallelism.

We analyze the problem of duplicates that naturally occur in RDFS reasoning and develop strategies towards its mitigation, exploiting all levels of our architecture. We implement and evaluate our approach on two real-world datasets and study its performance characteristics on different levels of parallelization. We conclude that RDFS entailment lends itself well to parallelization but can benefit even more from careful optimizations that take into account intricacies of modern parallel hardware.\n",
      "In RDF, a blank node (or anonymous resource or bnode) is a node in an RDF graph which is not identified by a URI and is not a literal. Several RDF/S Knowledge Bases (KBs) rely heavily on blank nodes as they are convenient for representing complex attributes or resources whose identity is unknown but their attributes (either literals or associations with other resources) are known. In this paper we show how we can exploit blank nodes anonymity in order to reduce the delta (diff) size when comparing such KBs. The main idea of the proposed method is to build a mapping between the bnodes of the compared KBs for reducing the delta size. We prove that finding the optimal mapping is NP-Hard in the general case, and polynomial in case there are not directly connected bnodes. Subsequently we present various polynomial algorithms returning approximate solutions for the general case. For making the application of our method feasible also to large KBs we present a signature-based mapping algorithm with n logn complexity. Finally, we report experimental results over real and synthetic datasets that demonstrate significant reductions in the sizes of the computed deltas.

      "We present D-SPARQ, a distributed RDF query engine that combines the MapReduce processing framework with a NoSQL distributed data store, MongoDB. The performance of processing SPARQL queries mainly depends on the efficiency of handling the join operations between the RDF triple patterns. Our system features two unique characteristics that enable efficiently tackling this challenge: 1) Identifying specific patterns of the input queries that enable improving the performance by running different parts of the query in a parallel mode. 2) Using the triple selectivity information for reordering the individual triples of the input query within the identified query patterns. The preliminary results demonstrate the scalability and efficiency of our distributed RDF query engine.\n",
      "Tables are widely used in Wikipedia articles to display relational information – they are inherently concise and information rich. However, aside from info-boxes, there are no automatic methods to exploit the integrated content of these tables. We thus present DRETa: a tool that uses DBpedia as a reference knowledge-base to extract RDF triples from generic Wikipedia tables.\n",
      "Although reaching the fifth star of the Open Data deployment scheme demands the data to be represented in RDF and linked, a generic and standard mapping procedure to deploy raw data in RDF was not established so far. Only the R2RML mapping language was standardized but its applicability is limited to mappings from relational databases to RDF. We propose the extension of R2RML to also support mappings of data sources in other structured formats. Broadening its scope, the focus is put on the mappings and their optimal reuse. The language becomes source-agnostic, and resources are integrated and interlinked at a primary stage.\n",
      "With the advent of Linked Data the amount of automatically generated machine-readable data on the Web, often obtained by means of mapping relational data to RDF, has risen significantly. However, manually created, quality-assured and crowd-sourced data based on ontologies, is not available in the quantities that would realise the full potential of the semantic Web. One of the barriers for semantic Web novices to create machine-readable data, is the lack of easy-to-use Web publishing tools that separate the schema modelling from the data creation. In this demonstration we present ActiveRaUL, a Web service that supports the automatic generation of Web form-based user interfaces from any input ontology. The resulting Web forms are unique in supporting users, inexperienced in semantic Web technologies, to create and maintain RDF data modelled according to an ontology. We report on a use case based on the Sensor Network Ontology that supports the viability of our approach.\n"

      "As a massive linked open data is available in RDF, the scalable storage and efficient retrieval using MapReduce have been actively studied. Most of previous researches focus on reducing the number of MapReduce jobs for processing join operations in SPARQL queries. However, the cost of shuffle phase still occurs due to their reduce-side joins. In this paper, we propose RDFChain which supports the scalable storage and efficient retrieval of a large volume of RDF data using a combination of MapReduce and HBase which is NoSQL storage system. Since the proposed storage schema of RDFChain reflects all the possible join patterns of queries, it provides a reduced number of storage accesses depending on the join pattern of a query. In addition, the proposed cost-based map-side join of RDFChain reduces the number of map jobs since it processes as many joins as possible in a map job using statistics.\n",

      "The details of reasoning in RDF are generally well known.  The model-theoretic characteristcs of RDF have been less studied, particularly when datatypes are added.

      "The vision behind the Web of Data is to extend the current document-oriented Web with machine-readable facts and structured data, thus creating a representation of general knowledge. However, most of the Web of Data is limited to being a large compendium of encyclopedic knowledge describing entities. A huge challenge, the timely and massive extraction of RDF facts from unstructured data, has remained open so far. The availability of such knowledge on the Web of Data would provide signiﬁcant beneﬁts to manifold applications including news retrieval, sentiment analysis and business intelligence. In this paper, we address the problem of the actuality of the Web of Data by presenting an approach that allows extracting RDF triples from unstructured data streams. We employ statistical methods in combination with deduplication, disambiguation and unsupervised as well as supervised machine learning techniques to create a knowledge base that reﬂects the content of the input streams. We evaluate a sample of the RDF we generate against a large corpus of news streams and show that we achieve a precision of more than 85%.\n",
      "The normative version of RDF Schema (RDFS) gives non-standard (intensional) interpretations to some standard notions such as classes and properties, thus departing from standard set-based semantics. In this paper we develop a standard set-based (extensional) semantics for the RDFS vocabulary while preserving the simplicity and computational complexity of deduction of the intensional version. This result can positively impact current implementations, as reasoning in RDFS can be implemented following common set-based intuitions and be compatible with OWL extensions.\n",
      "With thousands of RDF data sources available on the Web covering disparate and possibly overlapping knowledge domains, the problem of providing high-level descriptions (in the form of metadata) of their content becomes crucial. In this paper we introduce a theoretical framework for describing data sources in terms of their completeness. We show how existing data sources can be described with completeness statements expressed in RDF. We then focus on the problem of the completeness of query answering over plain and RDFS data sources augmented with completeness statements. Finally, we present an extension of the completeness framework for federated data sources.\n",
      "One of the main advantages of using semantically annotated data is that machines can reason on it, deriving implicit knowledge from explicit information. In this context, materializing every possible implicit derivation from a given input can be computationally expensive, especially when considering large data volumes. Most of the solutions that address this problem rely on the assumption that the information is static, i.e., that it does not change, or changes very infrequently. However, the Web is extremely dynamic: online newspapers, blogs, social networks, etc., are frequently changed so that outdated information is removed and replaced with fresh data. This demands for a materialization that is not only scalable, but also reactive to changes. In this paper, we consider the problem of incremental materialization, that is, how to update the materialized derivations when new data is added or removed. To this purpose, we consider the ρdf RDFS fragment [12], and present a parallel system that implements a number of algorithms to quickly recalculate the derivation. In case new data is added, our system uses a parallel version of the well-known semi-naive evaluation of Datalog. In case of removals, we have implemented two algorithms, one based on previous theoretical work, and another one that is more eﬃcient since it does not require a complete scan of the input. We have evaluated the performance using a prototype system called DynamiTE , which organizes the knowledge bases with a number of indices to facilitate the query process and exploits parallelism to improve the performance. The results show that our methods are indeed capable to recalculate the derivation in a short time, opening the door to reasoning on much more dynamic data than is currently possible.\n",
      "Type information is very valuable in knowledge bases. However, most large open knowledge bases are incomplete with respect to type information, and, at the same time, contain noisy and incorrect data. That makes classic type inference by reasoning diﬃcult. In this paper, we propose the heuristic link-based type inference mechanism SD-Type, which can handle noisy and incorrect data. Instead of leveraging T-box information from the schema, SDType takes the actual use of a schema into account and thus is also robust to misused schema elements.\n",
      "Geospatial extensions of SPARQL like GeoSPARQL and stSPARQL have recently been deﬁned and corresponding geospatial RDF stores have been implemented. However, there is no widely used benchmark for evaluating geospatial RDF stores which takes into account recent advances to the state of the art in this area. In this paper, we develop a benchmark, called Geographica, which uses both real-world and synthetic data to test the oﬀered functionality and the performance of some prominent geospatial RDF stores.\n",
      "Two complementary benchmarks have been proposed so far for the evaluation and continuous improvement of RDF stream processors: SRBench and LSBench. They put a special focus on diﬀerent features of the evaluated systems, including coverage of the streaming extensions of SPARQL supported by each processor, query processing throughput, and an early analysis of query evaluation correctness, based on comparing the results obtained by diﬀerent processors for a set of queries. However, none of them has analysed the operational semantics of these processors in order to assess the correctness of query evaluation results. In this paper, we propose a characterization of the operational semantics of RDF stream processors, adapting well-known models used in the stream processing engine community: CQL and SECRET. Through this formalization, we address correctness in RDF stream processor benchmarks, allowing to determine the multiple answers that systems should provide. Finally, we present CSRBench, an extension of SRBench to address query result correctness veriﬁcation using an automatic method.\n",
      "Processing large volumes of RDF data requires sophisticated tools. In recent years, much eﬀort was spent on optimizing native RDF stores and on repurposing relational query engines for large-scale RDF processing. Concurrently, a number of new data management systems— regrouped under the NoSQL (for “not only SQL”) umbrella—rapidly rose to prominence and represent today a popular alternative to classical databases. Though NoSQL systems are increasingly used to manage RDF data, it is still diﬃcult to grasp their key advantages and drawbacks in this context. This work is, to the best of our knowledge, the ﬁrst systematic attempt at characterizing and comparing NoSQL stores for RDF processing. In the following, we describe four diﬀerent NoSQL stores and compare their key characteristics when running standard RDF benchmarks on a popular cloud infrastructure using both single-machine and distributed deployments.\n"

However, the distributed nature of these systems introduces several performance challenges, e.g., disk I/O and network shuffling overhead, especially for RDF queries that involve multiple join operations. To alleviate these challenges, this paper studies the effect of several optimization techniques that enhance the performance of RDF queries. Based on the query workload, reduced sets of intermediate results (or reductions, for short) that are common for certain join pattern(s) are computed. Furthermore, these reductions are not computed beforehand, but are rather computed only for the frequent join patterns in an online fashion using Bloom filters. Rather than caching the final results of each query, we show that caching the reductions allows reusing intermediate results across multiple queries that share the same join patterns. In addition, we introduce an efficient solution for RDF queries with unbound properties. Based on a realization of the proposed optimizations on top of Spark, extensive experimentation using two synthetic benchmarks and a real dataset demonstrates how these optimizations lead to an order of magnitude enhancement in terms of preprocessing, storage, and query performance compared to the state-of-the-art solutions.\n",

To address both of these challenges, we propose GraFa: a faceted browsing system for heterogeneous large-scale RDF graphs based on a novel caching method that performs an offline analysis of the input graph in order to identify a subset of the exponential number of possible facets that are suitable candidates for precomputation.

However, in an ideal scenario, the user should not be limited only to static summaries. On the contrary, starting from the summary, s/he should be able to further explore the data source requesting more detailed information for a particular part of it. In this paper, we present a new approach enabling the dynamic exploration of summaries through two novel operations zoom and extend. Extend focuses on a specific subgraph of the initial summary, whereas zoom on the whole graph, both providing granular information access to the end-user. We show that calculating these operators is NP-complete and we provide approximations for their calculation. Then, we show that indeed using extend we can answer more queries focusing on specific nodes, whereas using global zoom, we can answer overall more queries. Finally we show that the algorithms employed can efficiently approximate both operators.\n",

      "RDF stream reasoning is gaining more and more attention but current research mainly focuses on logical frameworks which aim to formalize the query semantics and enhance the complexity of reasoning ability. These frameworks are evaluated on prototype systems based on a centralized design and suffer from limited scalability. A common way to enhance system scalability is to adopt a distributed approach. Moreover, the study of applying distributed solution for expressive RDF stream reasoning is still missing. In this paper, we explore the ability of modern Big Data platform to handle highly expressive temporal Datalog/Answer Set Programming(ASP) over RDF data streams. In order to achieve our goal, we first discuss some key features to parallelize Datalog/ASP program, and we associate these features to the two well known distributed stream processing models, namely Bulk Synchronous Processing (BSP) and Record-at-A-Time (RAT). We build a technical demonstrator called BigSR on top of Spark(BSP) and Flink(RAT) to support our evaluations, and identify the pros and cons of each model. Our experiments show that, BigSR achieves high throughput beyond million-triples per second using a rather small cluster of machines.\n",
      "This study exploits knowledge expressed by RDF Knowledge Bases (KBs) to enhance Truth Discovery performance. Truth Discovery aims to identify facts (true claims) when conflicting claims are provided by several sources. Based on the assumption that true claims are provided by reliable sources and reliable sources provide true claims, Truth Discovery models iteratively compute value confidence and source trustworthiness in order to determine which claims are true. We propose a model that takes advantage of the knowledge extracted from an existing RDF KB in form of rules. These rules are used to quantify the evidence given by the RDF KB to support a claim. Then, this evidence is integrated in the computation of value confidence to improve its estimation. Enhancing truth discovery models allows to efficiently obtain a larger set of reliable facts that vice versa can be used to populate RDF KBs. Empirical experiments on real-world datasets show the potential of the proposed approach which lead to an improvement up to 18% w.r.t. the model we modified.\n",
      "The steadily-growing popularity of semantic data on the Web and the support for aggregation queries in SPARQL 1.1 have propelled the interest in Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) and data cubes in RDF. Query processing in such settings is challenging because SPARQL OLAP queries usually contain many triple patterns with grouping and aggregation. Moreover, one important factor of query answering on Web data is its provenance, i.e., metadata about its origin. Some applications in data analytics and access control require to augment the data with provenance metadata and run queries that impose constraints on this provenance. This task is called provenance-aware query answering. In this paper, we investigate the benefit of caching some parts of an RDF cube augmented with provenance information when answering provenance-aware SPARQL queries. We propose provenance-aware caching (PAC), a caching approach based on a provenance-aware partitioning of RDF graphs, and a benefit model for RDF cubes and SPARQL queries with aggregation. Our results on real and synthetic data show that PAC outperforms significantly the LRU strategy (least recently used) and the Jena TDB native caching in terms of hit-rate and response time.\n",

      "Advances in Data Management methods have resulted in a wide array of storage  solutions having varying query capabilities and supporting different data formats. Traditionally, heterogeneous data was transformed off-line into a unique format and migrated to a unique data management system, before being uniformly queried. However, with the increasing amount of heterogeneous datasets, and considering that these sources are often dynamic, modern applications prefer accessing the original fresh data directly. Addressing this requirement, we designed and developed Squerall, a software framework that enables the querying of large and  heterogeneous  data  on-the-fly  without  prior  data  transformation. Squerall is built from the ground up with extensibility in consideration. It can be extended to support more data sources. In this demonstration, we explain this extensibility aspect and demonstrate step-by-step how to add support for RDF data, a new extension to the previously supported  range of data sources.\n",

      "Next to their latest version, Linked Open Datasets on the Web can also contain useful information in or between previous versions. In order to exploit this information, we can maintain history in RDF archives. Existing approaches either require much storage space, or they do not meet sufficiently expressive querying demands. In this extended abstract, we discuss an RDF archive indexing technique that has a low storage overhead, and adds metadata for reducing lookup times. We introduce algorithms based on this technique for efficiently evaluating versioned queries. Using the BEAR RDF archiving benchmark, we evaluate our implementation, called OSTRICH. Results show that OSTRICH introduces a new trade-off regarding storage space, ingestion time, and querying efficiency. By processing and storing more metadata during ingestion time, it significantly lowers the average lookup time for versioning queries. Our storage technique reduces query evaluation time through a preprocessing step during ingestion, which only in some cases increases storage space when compared to other approaches. This allows data owners to store and query multiple versions of their dataset efficiently, lowering the barrier to historical dataset publication and analysis.\n",
      "Several centralised RDF systems support datalog reasoning by using the  emph{semina\"\"{i}ve algorithm}, which can efficiently precompute and store all logically implied triples. As RDF datasets keep increasing in size, they can easily exceed the capacity of centralised RDF systems, and a common solution to this problems is to distribute datasets in a cluster of shared-nothing servers. While numerous distributed query answering techniques are known in the literature, distributed implementation of the semina\"\"{i}ve algorithm is less  understood, and most distributed RDF stores either support no reasoning, or  they can handle only a limited datalog fragments. To address this, in this  paper we extend our emph{dynamic data exchange} approach to distributed query  answering cite{Potter} to a comprehensive reasoning algorithm that can handle  arbitrary rules while preserving important properties such as nonrepetition of  inferences. We also show empirically that our algorithm scales well to very large RDF datasets.\n",
      "Over the last years, Linked Data has grown continuously.   Today, we count more than 10,000 datasets being available online following Linked Data standards.   These standards allow data to be machine readable and inter-operable.  Nevertheless, many applications, such as data integration, search, and interlinking, cannot take full advantage of Linked Data if it is of low quality.  There exist a few approaches for the quality assessment of Linked Data, but their performance degrades with the increase in data size and quickly grows beyond the capabilities of a single machine.  In this paper, we present DistQualityAssessment -- an open source implementation of quality assessment of large RDF datasets that can scale out to a cluster of machines.  This is the first distributed, in-memory approach for computing different quality metrics for large RDF datasets using Apache Spark. We also provide a quality assessment pattern that can be used to generate new scalable metrics that can be applied to big data.

The results show that our approach is more generic, efficient, and scalable as compared to previously proposed approaches.\n",
      "Despite the prospect of a vast Web of interlinked data, the Semantic Web today mostly fails to meet its potential. One of the main problems it faces is rooted in its current architecture, which totally relies on the availability of the servers providing access to the data. These servers are subject to failures, which often results in situations where some data is unavailable. Recent advances have proposed decentralized peer-to-peer based architectures to alleviate this problem. However, for query processing these approaches mostly rely on flooding, a standard technique for peer-to-peer systems, which can easily result in very high network traffic and hence cause high query response times. To still enable efficient query processing in such networks, this paper proposes two indexing schemes, which in a decentralized fashion aim at efficiently finding nodes with relevant data for a given query: Locational Indices and Prefix-Partitioned Bloom Filters. Our experiments show that such indexing schemes are able to considerably speed up query processing times compared to existing approaches.\n",

With the advent of RDF as a highly expressive knowledge representation langugage for the Web, various implementations for RDF lists have been proposed. Yet, there is no benchmark so far dedicated to evaluate the performance of triple stores and SPARQL query engines on dealing with ordered linked data. Moreover, essential tasks for evaluating RDF lists, like generating  datasets containing RDF lists of various sizes, or generating the same RDF list using different modelling choices, are cumbersome and unprincipled. In this paper, we propose texttt{List.MID}, a systemmatic benchmark for evaluating systems serving RDF lists. texttt{List.MID} consists of a dataset generator, which creates RDF list data in various models and of different sizes; and a set of SPARQL queries.

      "Relation prediction is often a sparse prediction when only a few relations exist among a large number of entities. Due to the higher computational complexity, higher-order feature interactions (over 3rd-order) are currently ignored and as a result, more useful information is lossed in sparse prediction. It becomes interesting to adopt higher-order feature interactions in relation predication with a low complexity. In this poster, we present a multi-order interaction neural network (MINN) for relation prediction, which can calculate the 2nd-order and 3rd-order feature interactions and automatically combine them within linear complexity. The proposed MINN contains the three layers: embedding, multi-order interaction pooling (MI-Pooling), and Deep & Wide. In embedding layer, we convert sparse features of entities and relations into dense features to narrow the size of features. In MI Pooling layer, the 2nd-order and 3rd-order feature interactions are calculated and combined in linear time, and then the results will be input into a deep neural network (DNN) for learning nonlinear feature in the last Deep & Wide layer, which will output the final prediction value. The experiments evaluating on two well-known datasets, WN18 and FB15k, show that MINN efficiently performs better than most of the state-of-the-art sparse models in relation prediction.\n",

      "Recent years have witnessed a rapid growth of knowledge graphs (KGs) such as Freebase, DBpedia, or YAGO. These KGs store billions of facts about real-world entities (e.g. people, places, and things) in the form of triples. KGs are playing an increasingly important role in enhancing the intelligence of Web and enterprise search and in supporting information integration and retrieval. Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud interlinks KGs and other data sources using the W3C Resource Description Framework (RDF) and makes accessible on web querying. Despite these impressive advances, there are still major limitations regarding coverage with missing information, such as type, properties, and relations.   In recent years much attention has been paid to KG completion tasks, which automatically infer missing facts and missing types in a KG. Although some approaches have been proposed for type inference in KG, these are successful in extracting common types, such as `Person', 'Artist', 'Movie' or 'Actor'. However, there is still a big gap in fine-grained types of entities to be inferred that is highly important for exploring specific lists and collections with web searching. Generally, very limited numbers of observed data for fine-grained types present in KGs, and this poses a high challenge in developing approaches for inferring entities of the fine-grained types. In order to address the issue,  This paper proposes a new approach based on a tensor model for fine-grained type inference. This new approach is explicitly modeled for leveraging domain knowledge and utilizing additional data outside KG, that allows a ranked representation for type inference and result in richer data for tensor factorization.  Further improvements in efficiency are achieved by extending the model to probabilistic inference based on entity similarity and typed class classification.   Our aim is to automatically identify entities to be semantically interpretable by having fine-grained types in DBpedia. This paper embeddings entire DBpedia, and applies a new approach based on a tensor model for fine-grained entity type inference. We demonstrate the benefits of our task in the context of fine-grained entity type inference applying on DBpedia, and by producing a large number of resources in different fine-grained entity types for connecting them to DBpedia type classes.\n",
      "Data processing can be restricted by policies (constraints),  to, among others, protect the individual’s privacy, a fundamental hu-  man right. Software used to process data may utilize ontologies to rep-  resent knowledge as concepts, relationships and restrictions, to solve the  task at hand. In knowledge representations, restrictions are typically ex-  pressed as axioms, whereas policy-related restrictions have more applica-  tion specific focus, and are usually expressed as constraints. Thus, vari-  ous purposes demand differently modeled restrictions. However, existing  methodologies do not provide guidelines on how to model restrictions, nor  do they distinguish between axioms and constraints. This PhD research  aims to investigate the systematic creation of RDF-based restrictions,  and their use in policy-compliant data processing. In this paper, I out-  line my PhD research to (i) analyze the current use of restrictions in  ontologies, (ii) provide methodological guidelines to model restrictions,  and (iii) apply RDF-based restrictions on data processing to assess pol-  icy compliance both before and after the fact. RDF-based restrictions  can be modeled by various recommended languages, including OWL,  ODRL, SHACL or ShEx. Methodological guidelines to choose the ap-  propriate language or language combinations for an application scenario  are beneficial for the knowledge engineering community. Additionally,  systematically created restrictions can be used for privacy-compliance  assessments.\n",
      "Since the 2001 envisioning of the Semantic Web (SW), the main research focus in SW reasoning has been on the soundness and completeness of reasoners. While these reasoners assume the veracity of input data, the reality is that the Web of data is inherently noisy. Although there has been recent work on noise-tolerant reasoning, it has focused on type inference rather than full RDFS reasoning. Even though RDFS closure generation can be seen as a Knowledge Graph (KG) completion problem, the problem setting is different| making KG embedding techniques that were designed for link prediction not suitable for RDFS reasoning. This paper documents a novel approach that extends noise-tolerance in the SW to full RDFS reasoning. Our embedding technique--that is tailored for RDFS reasoning-- consists of layering RDF graphs and encoding them in the form of 3D adjacency matrices where each layer layout forms a graph word. Each input graph and its entailments are then represented as sequences of graph words, and RDFS inference can be formulated as translation of these graph words sequences, achieved through neural machine translation. Our evaluation on LUBM1 synthetic dataset shows 97% validation accuracy and 87:76% on a subset of DBpedia while demonstrating a noise-tolerance unavailable with rule-based reasoners.\n"

In SAQ relational data in a back-end DBMS is exposed as an RDF view, called the RD-view. SAQ can process arbitrary SPARQL queries to the RD-view. Long-term preservation as RDF of selected parts of a relational database is specified by SPARQL queries to the RD-view. Such queries usually select sets of RDF properties and thus in the query definition a property p is unknown. We call such queries unbound-property queries. This class of queries is also present in the SPARQL benchmarks. We optimize unbound-property queries by introducing a query transformation algorithm called Group Common Terms, GCT. It pulls out from a DNF normalized query those common terms that can be translated to SQL predicates accessing the relational database. Our experiments using the Berlin SPARQL benchmark show that GCT improves substantially the query execution time to a back-end commercial relational DBMS for both selective and unselective unbound-property queries. We compared the performance of our approach with the performance of other systems processing SPARQL queries over views of relational databases and showed that GCT improves scalability compared to the approaches used by the other systems. \n",
      "Conjunctive query answering is a key reasoning service for many ontology-basedapplications. With the advent of lightweight ontology languages, such as OWL2 QL, several query answering systems have been proposed which compute the socalled emph{UCQ rewriting} of a given query. It is often the case in realisticscenarios, that users refine their original queries, by e.g., extending themwith new constraints and making them more precise. To the best of ourknowledge, in such cases, all OWL 2 QL systems would need to recompute therewriting of the refined query from scratch. In this paper we study the problemof computing the rewriting of the refined query by `extending\n",
      "Quad stores have a number of features that make them very attractive for Semantic Web applications.  Quad stores use Named Graphs to give contextual information to RDF graphs. Developers can use these contexts to incorporate meta-data such as provenance and versioning. The OWL language specification provides the owl:imports construct as one of the key ways to reuse the ontologies on the Semantic Web. When one ontology imports another through the owl:imports statement, all axioms from the imported ontology are brought to the source ontology. When implementing an online ontology repository, we have explored a number of different approaches to reflect these imports and contextual information in a quad store. These approaches have a direct impact on storage requirements, query articulation, and reusability.This paper describes different models to represent contextual information, ontology imports and versioning.  We have performed the experiments in the context of storing ontologies from the BioPortal ontology repository. This repository has 304 ontologies, and multiple versions for many of them. We extract metrics on the levels of imports, and the storage and performance requirements and discuss the trade-offs between query articulation, reusability and scalability.\n",

      "In this paper we present a preliminary study with Explorator, a tool for exploring RDF data by direct manipulation.

      "Many applications in analytical domains often have the need to 'connect the dots' i.e., query about the structure of data. In bioinformatics for example, it is typical to want to query about interactions between proteins. The aim of such queries is to 'extract' relationships between entities i.e. paths from a data graph. Often, such queries will specify certain constraints that qualifying results must satisfy e.g. paths involving a set of mandatory nodes. Unfortunately, most present day Semantic Web query languages including the current draft of the anticipated recommendation SPARQL, lack the ability to express queries about arbitrary path structures in data. In addition, many systems that support some limited form of path queries rely on main memory graph algorithms limiting their applicability to very large scale graphs. In this paper, we present an approach for supporting Path Extraction queries. Our proposal comprises (i) a query language SPARQ2L which extends SPARQL with path variables and path variable constraint expressions, and (ii) a novel query evaluation framework based on efficient algebraic techniques for solving path problems which allows for path queries to be efficiently evaluated on disk resident RDF graphs. The effectiveness of our proposal is demonstrated by a performance evaluation of our approach on both real world based and synthetic datasets.\n",
      "Object-oriented programming is the current mainstream programming paradigm but existing RDF APIs are mostly triple-oriented. Traditional techniques for bridging a similar gap between relational databases and object-oriented programs cannot be applied directly, given the different nature of Semantic Web data, as can for example   be seen in the semantics of class membership, inheritance relations, and object conformance to schemas.<br /><br /> We present ActiveRDF, an object-oriented API for managing RDF data that offers full manipulation and querying of RDF data, does not rely on a schema and fully conforms to RDF(S) semantics. ActiveRDF can be used with different RDF data stores, adapters have been implemented to generic SPARQL endpoints, Sesame, Jena, Redland and YARS and new adapters can be added easily.  In addition, integration with the popular Ruby on Rails framework enables fast development of Semantic Web applications.\n",
      "Ontology summarization is very important to quick understanding and selection of ontologies. In this paper, we study extractive summarization of ontology, which generates an indicative summary of ontology automatically by extracting a salient part of ontology. We use a notion of RDF sentence as the basic unit of ontology. An RDF Sentence Graph is proposed to characterize the linkage between RDF sentences derived from ontology from the viewpoint of a surfer. The salience of an RDF sentence is assessed in terms of its \"centrality\" in the graph. We propose to summarize an ontology as a set of salient RDF sentences extracted from the ontology according to a re-ranking strategy. We compare several methods in assessing the salience of RDF sentences and give an overall evaluation of experimented results. Experiments show that the RDF Sentence Graph approach to ontology summarization is feasible.\n",
      "The World Wide Web Consortium's RDF standard primarily consists of (subject,property,object) triples that specify the value that a given subject has for a given property.  However, it is frequently the case that even for a fixed subject and property, the value varies with time (examples of such properties include salary, weight, etc.).  As a consequence, efforts have been made to annotate RDF triples with \"valid time\" intervals. However, to date, no proposals exist for efficient indexing of such temporal RDF databases.  It is clearly beneficial to store RDF data in a relational DB - however, standard relational indexes are inadequately equipped to handle RDF's graph structure. In this paper, we propose the tGRIN index structure that builds a specialized index for temporal RDF that is physically stored in an RDBMS. Past efforts to store RDF in relational stores include Jena2 from HP, Sesame from OpenRDF.org, and 3store from the University of Southampton. We show that even when these efforts are augmented with well known temporal indexes like R+ trees, SR-trees, ST-index, and MAP21, the tGRIN index exhibits superior performance.  In terms of index build time, tGRIN takes two thirds or less of the time used by any other system, and it uses a comparable amount of  memory and less disk space than Jena, Sesame and 3store. More importantly, tGRIN can answer queries three to six times faster for average query graph patterns and five to ten times faster for complex queries than these systems.\n"

      "The emergence of Semantic Web technologies and standards such as Resource Description Framework (RDF) has introduced novel data storage models such as the RDF Graph Model. In this paper, we present a research effort called R2D, which attempts to bridge the gap between RDF and RDBMS concepts by presenting a relational view of RDF data stores. Thus, R2D is essentially a relational wrapper around RDF stores that aims to make the variety of stable relational tools that are currently in the market available to RDF stores without data duplication and synchronization issues.\n",
      "The Semantic Web community, until now, has used traditional database systems for the storage and querying of RDF data. The SPARQL query language also closely follows SQL syntax. As a natural consequence, most of the SPARQL query processing techniques are based on database query processing and optimization techniques. For SPARQL join query optimization, previous works like RDF-3X and Hexastore have proposed to use 6-way indexes on the RDF data. Although these indexes speed up merge-joins by orders of magnitude, for complex join queries generating large intermediate join results, the scalability of the query processor still remains a challenge. In this paper, we introduce (i) BitMat -- a compressed bit-matrix structure for storing huge RDF graphs, and (ii) a novel, light-weight SPARQL join query processing method that employs an initial pruning technique, followed by a variable-binding-matching algorithm on BitMats to produce the final results. Our query processing method does not build intermediate join tables and works directly on the compressed data. We have demonstrated our method against RDF graphs of upto 1.33 billion triples -- the largest among results published until now (single-node, non-parallel systems), and have compared our method with the state-of-the-art RDF stores -- RDF-3X and MonetDB. Our results show that the competing methods are most effective with highly selective queries. On the other hand, BitMat can deliver 2-3 orders of magnitude better performance on complex, low-selectivity queries over massive data.\n",
      "In the more dynamic environments emerging from ad hoc and peer-to-peer networks, our research has explored the extent to which Web-based knowledge sharing as well as community formation require automation to understand human-readable content in a more distributed manner. RDFa is a syntactic format which can leverage this issue by allowing machine-readable data to be easily integrated into XHTML Web pages. Although there is a growing number of tools and techniques for generating and distilling RDFa, comparatively little work has been carried out on publishing existing RDF data sets as an XHTML+RDFa serialization. This paper proposes a generic approach to integrating RDF data into Web pages using the concept of automatically discovered \"topic nodes\". RDFa≤ is a proof-of-concept implementation of this approach and provides an on-line service assisting users in generating and personalizing pages with RDFa. We provide experimental results that support the viability of our approach to generating Web documents such as FOAF-based online profiles as well as RDF vocabularies with little user intervention.\n",
      "Abstract--- RDF and RDFS have recently become very popular as frameworks for representing data and meta-data in form of a domain description, respectively. RDF data can also be thought of as graph data. In this paper, we focus on keyword-based querying of RDF data. In the existing approaches for answering such keyword queries, keywords are mapped to nodes in the graph and their neighborhoods are explored to extract subgraph(s) of the data graph that contain(s) information relevant to the query. In order to restrict the computational effort, a fixed distance bound is used to define the neighborhoods of nodes. In this paper we present an elegant algorithm for keyword query processing on RDF data that does not assume such a fixed bound. The approach adopts a pruned exploration mechanism where closely related nodes are identified, subgraphs are pruned and joined using suitable hook nodes. The system dynamically manages the distance depending on the closeness between the keywords. The working of the algorithm is illustrated using a fragment of AIFB institute data represented as an RDF graph.\n",
      "The demo will present CoSi, a system that enables context-sensitive interpretation of keyword queries on RDF databases. The techniques for representing, managing and exploiting query history are central to achieving this objective. The demonstration will show the effectiveness of our approach for capturing a user's querying context from their query history. Further, it will show how context is utilized to influence the interpretation of a new query. The demonstration is based on DBPedia, the RDF representation of Wikipedia.\n",

We haveevaluated H2RDF against state-of-the-art RDF stores: Oursystem achieves the best of both worlds, answering simplejoins as fast as centralized stores and greatly outperformingboth distributed and centralized schemes for large, multiple-join queries. In this demonstration we showcase the system'sfunctionality through an interactive GUI.

      "D2RQ is a popular RDB-to-RDF mapping platform that supports mapping relational databases to RDF and posing SPARQL queries to these relational databases.

      "Mapping relational databases to RDF is a fundamental problem for the development of the Semantic Web.  We present a solution, inspired by draft methods defined by the W3C where relational databases are directly mapped to RDF and OWL.  Given a relational database schema and its integrity constraints, this direct mapping produces an OWL ontology, which, in turn provides the basis for generating RDF instances.  The semantics of this mapping is defined using Datalog. Two fundamental properties of such mappings are information preservation and query preservation. We prove that our mapping satisfies both conditions, in the general and practical scenario where relational databases contain null values. We also consider two desirable properties of such mappings: monotonicity and semantics preservation. We prove that our mapping is monotone and also prove that no monotone mapping, including ours, is semantic preserving.  We realize that monotonicity is an obstacle for semantic preservation and thus present a non-monotone direct mapping that is semantics preserving.\n",

      "The Web of Data is producing increasingly large RDF datasets from diverse fields of knowledge, pushing the Web to a data-to-data cloud.

First, we propose a binary serialization format for RDF, called HDT. It partitions and efficiently represents three components of RDF data: Header, Dictionary and Triples. Then, we focus on dictionary and triples efficient structures, as long as they take part of HDT representation as well as most applications performing on huge RDF datasets.

      "Linked Data querying over cached indexes of Web data often suffers from stale or missing results due to infrequent updates and partial coverage of available sources. Conversely, live decentralised approaches offer fresh results taken directly from the Web, but suffer from slow response times due to the expense of numerous remote lookups at runtime. We thus propose a hybrid query approach that improves upon both paradigms, offering fresher results from a broader range of sources than Linked Data caches while offering faster results than live querying. Our hybrid query engine takes a cached and live query engine as black boxes, where a hybrid query planner splits an input query and delegates the appropriate sub-queries to each interface. In this paper, we discuss the core query-planning issues and their main strengths and weaknesses. We also present coherence measures to quantify the coverage and freshness for cached indexes of Linked Data, and show how these measures can be used during query planning to maximise the trade-off between fresh results and fast query execution. -> https://w3id.org/scholarlydata/inproceedings/ekaw2012/paper/research/71\n"
